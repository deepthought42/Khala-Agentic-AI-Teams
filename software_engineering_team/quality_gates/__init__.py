"""
Quality gates: cross-cutting review agents (Code Review, QA, Security, Acceptance Verifier, DbC).

These agents are invoked inside backend and frontend per-task workflows. None are task assignees.
Accessibility Expert lives under frontend_team/ but is conceptually part of this set for frontend.

Shared contract: see quality_gates.protocols.ReviewResult (approved: bool, issues-like list).
