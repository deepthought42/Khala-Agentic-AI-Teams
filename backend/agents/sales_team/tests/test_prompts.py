"""Regression tests for the sales_team.prompts package.

Two flavours:

1. **Byte-identical SYSTEM_PROMPT** — guards against accidental drift while the
   prompts package is young. The original inline ``_X_SYSTEM_PROMPT`` strings
   were extracted to leaf modules; ``SYSTEM_PROMPT`` after rendering an empty
   ``FEWSHOT_EXAMPLES`` must equal ``_BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`` for that module.

2. **TASK_TEMPLATE.format() == f-string** — proves the conversion from inline
   f-strings to ``str.format``-based templates didn't change the rendered
   user prompt for any agent. We render each template against a representative
   context and compare against the equivalent f-string.
