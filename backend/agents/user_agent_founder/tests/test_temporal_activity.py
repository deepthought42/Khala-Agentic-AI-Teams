"""Sanity check for the Temporal activity's call shape.

Before this was fixed, the activity called ``run_workflow(**request)`` where
``request`` was a dict, but the actual signature is
``run_workflow(run_id, store, agent)``. That meant the activity would
always crash the moment it executed — the workflow could never succeed.

The activity now takes a plain ``run_id`` string, reconstructs the store
and agent locally, and delegates to the orchestrator. These tests pin
that contract.
