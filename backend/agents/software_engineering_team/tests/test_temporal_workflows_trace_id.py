"""Tests that the SE Temporal workflows generate one ``trace_id`` per run and forward it to
every phase activity — the workflow-side half of threading ``trace_id`` through the 4-phase
pipeline (the activity-side half is covered in ``test_temporal_activities.py``).

The full server-backed ``WorkflowEnvironment`` needs a test-server binary that is unavailable
here, so (as in ``deepthought/tests/test_temporal_workflow.py``) these tests drive each
workflow's ``run`` coroutine directly with ``asyncio`` while patching ``workflow.execute_activity``
(a fake dispatcher keyed on activity ``__name__``) and ``workflow.uuid4`` (a deterministic
counter — the real ``uuid.uuid4``/``shared.observability.new_trace_id`` must never be called
from workflow code, since workflow code must be deterministic across replays).
