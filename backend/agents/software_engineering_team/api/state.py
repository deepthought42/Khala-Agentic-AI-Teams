"""Shared module-level state and pure helpers for the SE team API.

Single owner of the mutable globals (the orchestrator-thread registry, status
sets, workspace/log config) and the small pure parse/validation helpers the
route modules reuse. Imports nothing from the route or background modules, so it
never participates in an import cycle.

Invariants:
    - The orchestrator-thread registry itself lives in
      ``shared.run_thread_registry.RunThreadRegistry``; background threads and routes go through
      the registry's methods (e.g. ``_is_orchestrator_alive``) rather than poking its internals.
