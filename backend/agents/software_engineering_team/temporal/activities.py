    """Build the ``on_defaulted`` hook that persists fabricated answers to the job.

    Accumulates rather than overwrites, because the hook fires once per PRA
    clarification ROUND, not once per activity execution:
    ``wait_for_product_analysis_completion``'s ``_on_poll`` invokes the same
    callback on every poll while PRA reports ``waiting_for_answers``, and PRA's own
    review loop raises several unrelated rounds with fresh ids. Under
    ``allow_repause=False`` nothing raises, so each round is defaulted in turn and a
    plain overwrite would keep only the last one -- silently discarding the record
    of every earlier round's fabricated answers, which is the failure this whole
    hook exists to prevent.

    Preconditions:
        - ``job_id`` identifies an existing run-team job record.
    Postconditions:
        - Returns a one-argument callable suitable as ``on_defaulted``. Each call
          merges its records into a per-execution accumulator and writes the whole
          accumulated list to ``defaulted_questions``, so the job record always
          carries every round defaulted so far, in the order they were defaulted.
        - De-duplicates on ``(question_id, question_text)``, not ``question_id``
          alone. PRA's parser falls back to a positional ``q{index}`` id
          (``question_processing.parse_open_question``), so two unrelated rounds can
          reuse one id; keying on the id alone would drop the second question's
          record as a duplicate of the first. Last write wins for a genuine repeat
          of the same question, which is the answer actually submitted most
          recently.
        - Writing the full accumulated list (rather than appending server-side)
          keeps a Temporal retry idempotent: a retry runs a fresh accumulator and
          rebuilds the field from scratch, so entries are never doubled.
    Invariants:
        - The accumulator is per-callable and therefore per-activity-execution; it
          is never shared across jobs or retries.

    Preconditions: a trace id is already bound (callers must go through
        :func:`plan_project_activity`); ``spec_parse_result`` validates as a ``SpecParseResult``.
    Postconditions: returns a ``PlanResult`` dict; on the final Temporal attempt the job is
        marked FAILED, while a non-final attempt skips the FAILED write so a retry that
        later succeeds never leaves a transient FAILED status behind. Either way, the
        exception propagates to the activity wrapper. Uses ``spec_data.requirements_title``
        (set by Phase 1) as the adapter's spec title rather than re-parsing
        ``spec_data.spec_content`` via the LLM — avoids a second, nondeterministic parse and
        an unnecessary spec-intake LLM dependency; required for the sprint path, where
        ``spec_data.spec_content`` is synthesized Markdown, not LLM-parseable prose.

        When Planning raises a clarification question and ``submitted_answers`` is ``None``
        (a fresh pause, not a resume), this never reaches Planning's own success/failure
        branches: it persists the questions (mirroring thread-mode's
        ``orchestrator._build_planning_answer_callback``) and returns
        ``{"outcome": "paused", "resume_token": ..., "pending_questions": ...}`` instead of a
        ``PlanResult``, so the calling workflow can durably wait for a
        ``submit_planning_answers`` signal (via ``PlanningAnswerSignalMixin``) instead of this
        activity blocking. Matches thread-mode's invariant that Planning is never silently
        auto-answered (``auto_answer_questions=False`` in both modes) via a durable signal
        instead of a blocking poll loop.

        ``allow_repause=False`` suppresses a *further* pause on a resume: the callback then
        resolves every batch with whatever answers match AND defaults every question left
        unanswered (see ``build_temporal_planning_answer_callback``'s ``_default_answer``),
        logging a warning naming them AND recording them on the job record's
        ``defaulted_questions`` (surfaced by ``JobStatusResponse``), so a plan built
        partly on machine-chosen answers says so where a human reads it rather than
        only in a worker log line. Each record carries the question text and the
        chosen option's label, not just ids, since the pause envelope holding those
        questions is cleared before the replay. Every PRA round that gets defaulted
        accumulates (see ``_record_defaulted_questions``) -- the hook fires per
        round, not per execution. A terminal attempt clears the field before it runs,
        so a retry whose replay needs no defaults does not inherit the previous
        attempt's records. A failed audit write raises ``PlanningDefaultsNotRecorded``,
        which both the PRA poll loop and ``run_workflow`` pass through, so it fails
        this activity rather than degrading into a warning. Defaulting is the load-bearing half: the answers
        route rejects a batch missing any required question and every PRA question is
        required, so resolving with only the matches would leave the sub-job waiting out its
        poll timeout instead of resuming. In the designed flow this returns a
        ``PlanResult`` rather than another ``{"outcome": "paused"}`` -- but the
        suppression is not enforced here: if a ``PlanningAnswerPauseSignal`` is raised
        anyway, the handler below still persists the pause and returns
        ``{"outcome": "paused"}`` (logging a warning), and the calling workflow fails the
        run non-retryably. Stated to match ``plan_project_activity``'s docstring rather
        than promising more than this function delivers. The calling workflow uses it to bound its pause
        loop -- see ``build_temporal_planning_answer_callback`` for why an unbounded one
        cannot be relied on to terminate.
