    Returns PlanResult as a dict, or a ``{"outcome": "paused", ...}`` dict when Planning
    raises a clarification question (see ``_plan_project_activity_body``). ``trace_id``
    (workflow-supplied, or freshly generated when blank) is bound for the duration of this
    activity — see ``parse_spec_activity`` for why it must be passed explicitly here rather
    than inherited via contextvars. ``resume_token``/``submitted_answers`` are supplied by
    the calling workflow when re-invoking this activity after a prior pause was resolved by
    a ``submit_planning_answers`` signal; omitted on a fresh (unpaused) invocation.
    ``allow_repause=False`` suppresses a further pause *via the answer callback* (see
    ``build_temporal_planning_answer_callback``), which is what the calling workflow
    passes on the last round of its bounded pause loop -- Planning's question ids are
    LLM-minted and can drift across a replay, which would otherwise re-pause forever.
    It is not enforced in this function: a persisted pause replayed on re-entry, or a
    ``PlanningAnswerPauseSignal`` raised anyway, still returns ``{"outcome": "paused"}``
    here and the calling workflow fails the run non-retryably. The end-to-end guarantee
    holds across the two files; this one does not promise it alone.

    Preconditions:
        - ``job_id`` identifies an existing job, ``repo_path`` an existing directory, and
          ``spec_parse_result`` validates as a ``SpecParseResult``.
        - ``resume_token``/``submitted_answers`` are supplied together on a resume and
          omitted together on a fresh invocation.
        - Called as a Temporal activity, or directly in a test; both are supported --
          the beater and cancellation guards degrade to no-ops outside an activity
          context.
    Postconditions:
        A background beater (``_phase_beating``) emits ``activity.heartbeat()`` for the
        whole body, so a run longer than the workflow's ``PHASE_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_S``
        is not timed out and retried underneath itself — which is what previously let a
        superseded attempt run to completion and race the winner's writes to the job
        record. Because these are synchronous activities, that beater is also what
        delivers cancellation: with it running, the body's ``_abort_if_superseded``
        guards can see ``is_cancelled()`` and stop a superseded attempt before it
        writes — the pause envelope above all.

    Preconditions: a trace id is already bound (callers must go through
        :func:`plan_project_activity`); ``spec_parse_result`` validates as a ``SpecParseResult``.
    Postconditions: returns a ``PlanResult`` dict; on the final Temporal attempt the job is
        marked FAILED, while a non-final attempt skips the FAILED write so a retry that
        later succeeds never leaves a transient FAILED status behind. Either way, the
        exception propagates to the activity wrapper. Uses ``spec_data.requirements_title``
        (set by Phase 1) as the adapter's spec title rather than re-parsing
        ``spec_data.spec_content`` via the LLM — avoids a second, nondeterministic parse and
        an unnecessary spec-intake LLM dependency; required for the sprint path, where
        ``spec_data.spec_content`` is synthesized Markdown, not LLM-parseable prose.

        When Planning raises a clarification question and ``submitted_answers`` is ``None``
        (a fresh pause, not a resume), this never reaches Planning's own success/failure
        branches: it persists the questions (mirroring thread-mode's
        ``orchestrator._build_planning_answer_callback``) and returns
        ``{"outcome": "paused", "resume_token": ..., "pending_questions": ...}`` instead of a
        ``PlanResult``, so the calling workflow can durably wait for a
        ``submit_planning_answers`` signal (via ``PlanningAnswerSignalMixin``) instead of this
        activity blocking. Matches thread-mode's invariant that Planning is never silently
        auto-answered (``auto_answer_questions=False`` in both modes) via a durable signal
        instead of a blocking poll loop.

        ``allow_repause=False`` suppresses a *further* pause on a resume: the callback then
        resolves every batch with whatever answers match AND defaults every question left
        unanswered (see ``build_temporal_planning_answer_callback``'s ``_default_answer``),
        logging a warning naming them. Defaulting is the load-bearing half: the answers
        route rejects a batch missing any required question and every PRA question is
        required, so resolving with only the matches would leave the sub-job waiting out its
        poll timeout instead of resuming. In the designed flow this returns a
        ``PlanResult`` rather than another ``{"outcome": "paused"}`` -- but the
        suppression is not enforced here: if a ``PlanningAnswerPauseSignal`` is raised
        anyway, the handler below still persists the pause and returns
        ``{"outcome": "paused"}`` (logging a warning), and the calling workflow fails the
        run non-retryably. Stated to match ``plan_project_activity``'s docstring rather
        than promising more than this function delivers. The calling workflow uses it to bound its pause
        loop -- see ``build_temporal_planning_answer_callback`` for why an unbounded one
        cannot be relied on to terminate.

        A cancelled attempt writes nothing further. Every job-record write here is
        guarded by ``_abort_if_superseded`` -- the pause-envelope consume, the planning
        progress updater, the planning-failure status, the success ``requirements_title``
        write, and the pause envelope itself -- and the outer handler re-raises a
        cancellation (via ``raise_if_cancelled``) ahead of the FAILED write. Planning's
        ``run_workflow`` folds an aborted updater into ``success=False``, which is why
        the failure branch re-checks rather than trusting the exception type.
