    durably resolve a Planning clarification-question pause (see the Phase 2 loop in

    Planning is never silently auto-answered.

    Invariants:
        - The Phase 2 pause loop runs at most ``MAX_PLANNING_PAUSE_ROUNDS`` times. It
          terminates by construction, not by trusting Planning's LLM-minted question ids
          to stay put across a replay: the final round is dispatched with
          ``allow_repause=False``, and an activity that pauses anyway fails the run
