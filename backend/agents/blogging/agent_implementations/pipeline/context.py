class PipelineContext:
    """Mutable state threaded across the blogging pipeline stages.

    Split out so each stage (planning -> draft -> gates) can run as its own Temporal
    activity: the activity seeds a context from the previous stage's serialized DTO,
    runs the stage, and serializes the produced fields. In thread mode a single
    context is threaded through all three stages in-process.

    Invariants:
        - ``llm_client`` and ``length_policy`` are resolved (non-None) before any
          stage runs.
        - ``planning_phase_result``/``plan``/``elicited_stories_text`` are populated
          by the planning stage before the draft stage reads them.
        - ``covered_sections`` is the de-duplicated set of plan section titles that
          already received an author narrative (a fresh interview or a story-bank
          hit). It is populated by the planning stage in thread mode: it is
          ``None`` before the planning stage runs and a ``set[str]`` (possibly
          empty) afterward. The draft stage reads it, sorts it into a list, and
          threads it into the writer's draft and post-fill revision prompts, which
          then omit the ``[Author: ...]`` placeholder for the named sections instead
          of re-interviewing the author for a story planning already collected. An
          empty set suppresses nothing, reproducing the pre-existing prompts exactly.
          Threading it across the Temporal activity boundary is still a follow-up —
          ``PlanningStageResult`` doesn't carry it and neither
          ``draft_stage_activity`` nor ``gates_stage_activity`` re-seed it (unlike
          ``elicited_stories_text``, which both do) — so in Temporal mode it stays at
          its ``None`` default and no suppression happens, the same divergence
          ``selected_title`` has below.
        - ``selected_title`` is populated by the planning stage, after outline
          approval (``_run_title_selection``, a no-op without a configured job
          store). The draft stage reads it and threads it into the writer/revision
          inputs; at ``None`` (no job store, or no title chosen) the writer picks
          its own title. The gates stage also still runs its own, independent
          selection round today, whose result feeds only
          ``PublishingPack.title_options`` — it does not touch the
          already-written draft. Unlike ``plan``/``elicited_stories_text``,
          ``selected_title`` does not yet cross the Temporal activity boundary:
          ``draft_stage_activity``/``gates_stage_activity`` re-seed the context
          without it, so a Temporal-mode run sees it stay at its ``None`` default
          regardless of what the planning stage selected — only thread mode
          carries the planning stage's choice through today.
        - ``draft_result`` is populated by the draft stage before the gates stage
          reads it.
