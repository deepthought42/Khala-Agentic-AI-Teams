    """Draft stage: initial draft, interactive review, and the copy-edit loop.

    Also reads an optional ``allowed_claims.json`` artifact from ``ctx.work_dir``
    and threads it into the writer/revision prompts so factual claims can be
    tagged with ``[CLAIM:id]``.

    Preconditions:
        - The planning stage populated ``ctx.plan``/``ctx.planning_phase_result``/
          ``ctx.elicited_stories_text``/``ctx.selected_title`` (the last is
          ``None`` when planning skipped title selection, e.g. no job store, or
          — in Temporal mode today — because it does not yet cross the activity
          boundary; see ``PipelineContext``'s invariants). At ``None`` the writer
          is free to choose its own title.
        - ``ctx.covered_sections`` is the set of plan section titles that already
          received an author story during planning, or ``None``. This stage sorts it
          into the list the writer takes and threads it into the initial-draft
          ``WriterInput`` and the ``draft_input_kwargs`` handed to
          ``_fill_story_placeholders``, so the draft omits an ``[Author: ...]``
          placeholder for a section already covered instead of re-interviewing the
          author for a story they gave during planning. Empty or ``None`` is the
          documented no-op: the writer's prompts are then exactly what they were
          before the field existed. It is ``None`` in Temporal mode today —
          ``PlanningStageResult`` does not carry it and neither
          ``draft_stage_activity`` nor ``gates_stage_activity`` re-seeds it — so
          suppression is thread-mode-only until that plumbing lands, the same
          divergence ``selected_title`` currently has.
        - The human-in-the-loop steps (story-placeholder filling and the interactive
          draft-review loop with uncertainty questions / author feedback / guideline
          updates) require a job store: they run only when BOTH ``ctx.job_id`` and
          ``ctx.job_updater`` are non-None. In thread-mode / CLI / test runs without a
          job store they are skipped and the draft proceeds straight to the automated
          copy-edit loop (the story-placeholder skip is logged, since unfilled
          placeholders visibly degrade the output).
        - An optional ``allowed_claims.json`` artifact may exist in ``ctx.work_dir``.
          The planning stage now writes it (``run_planning`` /
          ``_persist_content_plan_artifacts`` call ``extract_allowed_claims()``
          with ``topic=ctx.brief.brief``), so in the normal pipeline path it is
          always present with a matching topic by the time this stage runs; it
          remains optional here (no-op when absent) for callers that invoke this
          stage without having run planning first (e.g. tests, or a caller that
          supplies its own artifact). If present, a dict, and its ``"topic"``
          field equals ``ctx.brief.brief`` exactly, its contents are passed to
          the draft writer and subsequent revision calls (including
          ``revise_from_user_feedback``) as ``allowed_claims``; a missing or
          non-dict artifact, a topic mismatch (a stale artifact from a reused
          ``work_dir``), or no ``work_dir`` at all is a no-op (matching the
          fact-check/validator gates' handling of the same artifact).
    Postconditions:
        - On success sets ``ctx.draft_result`` (and the possibly-updated
          ``ctx.elicited_stories_text``) and returns None.
        - Returns a terminal ``(planning_phase_result, draft_result, "FAIL")`` tuple
          if the job was cancelled/failed while awaiting user review. This tuple
          *sentinel* (rather than a dedicated ``PipelineAbortedError``) is a
          deliberate design choice: it keeps the abort shape identical to
          ``run_pipeline``'s ``(planning, draft, status)`` return so the thin
          sequencer can forward it unchanged, and avoids exception-based control flow
          across the Temporal activity boundary where state crosses as serialized
          DTOs, not live exceptions. ``run_gates_stage`` (terminal, no abort) returns
          ``None``; only the two stages that can abort use this sentinel.
    Raises:
        DraftError: when the required guideline files cannot be loaded
            (via ``_load_required_guidelines``, phase="draft") or when draft /
            copy-edit generation fails.
        BloggingError: any other blogging-domain failure raised by the draft or
            copy-edit agents propagates unchanged.
        CancelledError: a Temporal-native cancellation propagates (never swallowed).
