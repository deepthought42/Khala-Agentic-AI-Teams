"""Shared helpers used by more than one pipeline stage.

A handful of these functions (see each docstring's "Deferred import" note) look up
one of their own collaborators via a deferred import from the
``blog_writing_process_v2`` shim instead of a normal top-level import. That's not
decoration: ``agents.blogging.agent_implementations.blog_writing_process_v2`` is the
module the existing test suite monkeypatches (e.g.
``monkeypatch.setattr(blog_writing_process_v2, "get_blog_job", ...)``), and a Python
function resolves a bare global through the ``__dict__`` of the module it was
*defined* in — never through a re-export in some other module that merely imported a
reference to it. Binding the lookup at call time through the shim's own namespace is
what makes those patches keep taking effect now that this code lives outside the
monolith, mirroring ``agents.blogging.api.background``'s late ``_main`` imports (see
that module's docstring for the same rationale applied to the API layer's split).

            forwarded unchanged and never extended with the sections filled here:
            a gap on this path is identified by the ``[Author: ...]`` placeholder's
            topic text (``StoryGap.section_title`` is that topic truncated to 80

            section title. Adding one would name a non-section, often mid-word, in a

            covered. Stories collected here reach later prompts through
            ``elicited_stories_text`` instead.
        work_dir: Optional directory for draft artifacts. If ``None``, no draft
            artifact is persisted.
        iteration: Current draft iteration number.

    Preconditions:

          ``revise_from_user_feedback`` separately, via its own
          ``elicited_stories`` parameter).
        - When ``draft_text`` contains ``[Author: ...]`` placeholders,
          ``draft_input_kwargs`` contains every key in
          ``_REQUIRED_DRAFT_INPUT_KEYS`` (``audience``, ``tone_or_purpose``,
          ``selected_title``, ``allowed_claims``, ``target_word_count``,
          ``length_guidance``) — unchecked when there are no placeholders,
          since ``draft_input_kwargs`` then goes unused. ``covered_sections`` is
          deliberately NOT among the required keys: it is read with ``.get()`` so a
          caller without coverage data behaves exactly as before.
    Postconditions:
        - Returns ``(updated_draft_result, updated_elicited_stories_text)``.
        - When placeholders exist, the collected narratives and skip
          instructions are applied via a single
          ``draft_agent.revise_from_user_feedback`` call — one targeted
          revision, not a full re-draft — costing one LLM call (plus that
          call's own internal retries on transient failures), in place of
          the prior full-regeneration-plus-self-review path's two to four
          LLM calls.
        - When no placeholders exist, returns a ``WriterOutput`` wrapping the
          original ``draft_text`` and the unchanged ``elicited_stories_text``.
        - The pre-fill draft at ``draft_v{iteration}.md`` (written by the
          caller before this function runs, and already through
          ``_self_review``) is never reopened or overwritten here, under
          any of the paths below.
        - When placeholders exist, at least one narrative or skip topic is
          collected, the post-fill ``revise_from_user_feedback`` call
          succeeds, and ``work_dir`` is not ``None``, the post-fill
          revision is written to a distinct ``draft_v{iteration}.md``-
          sibling artifact, ``draft_v{iteration}_stories.md`` — so both
          remain on disk for diffing. When ``work_dir`` is ``None``, no
          artifact is written for either draft.
        - If the post-story revision call raises a non-cancellation
          exception, the original ``draft_text`` — including any unfilled
          ``[Author: ...]`` placeholders — is returned unchanged alongside
          the updated ``elicited_stories_text``; the failure is logged but
          not raised; no ``draft_v{iteration}_stories.md`` is written, and
          ``draft_v{iteration}.md`` remains the only draft artifact on disk.
        - If the job is already failed/cancelled before any interview
          completes (so both collected narratives and skipped topics are
          empty), the loop breaks early and the function returns the
          original ``draft_text`` unchanged without ever calling
          ``revise_from_user_feedback`` — so, likewise, no
          ``draft_v{iteration}_stories.md`` is written.

    Raises:
        TypeError: a precondition on ``draft_text``, ``plan``, ``llm_client``,
            or ``draft_agent`` is violated.
        ValueError: ``draft_input_kwargs`` already contains ``elicited_stories``,
            or is missing one of the keys in ``_REQUIRED_DRAFT_INPUT_KEYS``.
        CancelledError: a Temporal-native (or otherwise external) cancellation
            propagates unchanged from both the non-fatal story-bank-save
            guard below and the non-fatal revision guard — neither ever
            swallows it.

          pins a stable order (set iteration varies run to run under hash
          randomization).
