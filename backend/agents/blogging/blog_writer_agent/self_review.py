"""
Self-review for blog drafts: a deterministic mechanical pass (banned phrases,
vague citations, em/en dashes, reader address, staccato prose) followed by a
focused LLM review for subjective issues.

Free functions here take an explicit ``call_text`` callback instead of an
agent's bound ``_call_text`` method, so this module has no dependency on
``BlogWriterAgent`` (or on ``agent.py`` at all) and can be adopted by any
caller that can supply a ``(prompt, system_prompt) -> str`` text completion.

          prompt block (e.g. via ``agent._render_allowed_claims_section``), or ``""``
          when no allowed-claims artifact was supplied. This function embeds its

          when claims are listed, no tags at all when the artifact is present but
          empty — is never contradicted by a blanket "preserve everything"
          instruction layered on top.
        - ``stories_section`` is the caller's already-rendered author-stories context
          (e.g. via ``agent._render_self_review_stories_context``), or ``""`` when the
          draft was written without author stories. Its text is embedded unmodified,

    Postconditions:

          stories, so this rewrite runs under ``WRITING_SYSTEM_PROMPT`` — whose standing

          mechanical fix can replace a real story with the placeholder the draft prompt
          just suppressed. Like the claims block, this is a prompt instruction, not an
          enforced guarantee.
        - When ``stories_section`` is empty the prompt is byte-identical to one built
          without the parameter.

        - When ``allowed_claims_section`` is non-empty, the fix prompt includes its

          instructing the model to follow the claims policy it describes (this is
          a prompt instruction, not an enforced guarantee: the function does not
          validate or otherwise check that the model's rewrite obeys it).

          ``SELF_REVIEW_PROMPT``'s first check flags first-person narrative "that wasn't
          provided in the AUTHOR'S PERSONAL STORIES section", so a checker that never
          receives that section reads every genuine story as fabricated; and the fixer
          runs under ``WRITING_SYSTEM_PROMPT``, whose standing rule is to substitute an
          ``[Author: ...]`` placeholder wherever no story was supplied. Without the
          stories, this pass can convert a real, author-supplied story back into the
          placeholder the draft prompt just suppressed. Like the claims block, this is a
          prompt instruction, not an enforced guarantee.
        - When ``stories_section`` is empty both prompts are byte-identical to ones
          built without the parameter.
        - On success, returns the reviewed/fixed draft or the original when no issues.
        - When issues are found and ``allowed_claims_section`` is non-empty, the fix
          prompt includes its text unmodified (as its own paragraph, surrounded by
          blank-line spacing), instructing the model to follow the claims policy it
          describes (a prompt instruction, not an enforced guarantee: the function
          does not validate or otherwise check that the model's rewrite obeys it).
        - Three ways the response can resolve to "issues": (1) it parses to a
          JSON list, used directly; (2) it parses to a genuine top-level JSON
          object (the model's real "no issues" response), which returns the
          original ``draft`` unchanged without further rescanning; (3) it
          parses to anything else (a scalar, a malformed object, or fails to
          parse as JSON at all), in which case a prose-rescan
          (``extract_json_array_from_text``) attempts to salvage an issues
          array from the raw text, returning the original ``draft`` unchanged
          only if no array is recoverable that way either.
        - Whichever path above produces the list, elements lacking a truthy
          ``"issue"`` key are discarded before use; if none remain, returns the
          original ``draft`` unchanged.
        - On soft-fail (``LLMError`` excluding types re-raised below, or
          ``json.JSONDecodeError`` / ``TypeError`` / ``ValueError`` / ``AttributeError``),

    Both sub-steps (``fix_deterministic_violations``, ``llm_self_review``)
    already return their own *input* draft unchanged on a soft-fail, so this
    function has no additional failure handling of its own.

    Preconditions:
        - ``draft`` is a string (may be empty).
        - ``call_text`` is a ``(prompt, system_prompt) -> response`` text-completion
          callback (e.g. ``BlogWriterAgent._call_text``).
        - ``allowed_claims_section`` is the caller's already-rendered allowed-claims
          prompt block, or ``""`` when no allowed-claims artifact was supplied;
          forwarded unchanged to both sub-steps.
        - ``stories_section`` is the caller's already-rendered author-stories context,
          or ``""``; likewise forwarded unchanged to both sub-steps, so neither rewrite
          can replace an author-supplied story with an ``[Author: ...]`` placeholder.
    Postconditions:
        - Returns the draft after applying any deterministic fixes and any
          LLM self-review fixes.
        - If ``fix_deterministic_violations`` soft-fails, it returns the
          original ``draft`` unchanged, and ``llm_self_review`` then runs on
          that same original draft.
        - If ``llm_self_review`` soft-fails, it returns its own input
          unchanged — the deterministically-fixed draft when Step 1 ran and
          succeeded, or the original ``draft`` when Step 1 did not run (no
          violations) or itself soft-failed. It is NOT always the original
          ``draft`` passed to ``self_review``.
