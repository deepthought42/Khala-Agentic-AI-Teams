        Orchestrates the pass: build the prompt, invoke the LLM, parse the response,
        inject programmatic length feedback, derive approval, and return the output.

        Preconditions:
            - copy_editor_input is a CopyEditorInput instance.
            - The draft may be empty; if so, a minimal output is returned without calling the LLM.
        Postconditions:
            - Returns CopyEditorOutput with summary and feedback_items.
            - If the draft is empty (or whitespace-only), returns a minimal output with an
              explanatory summary and no feedback items, without invoking the LLM.
            - If feedback_output_path is set, best-effort writes the same output to
              that path before returning. This write may silently fail (e.g. permission
              denied or disk-full); such failures are logged at WARNING and never raised,
              so the returned output is authoritative and callers must not assume the
              file exists. The outcome is reported to the caller via
              `output.feedback_file_written` (True/False), which stays None when
