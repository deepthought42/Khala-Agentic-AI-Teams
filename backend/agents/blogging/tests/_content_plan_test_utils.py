"""Shared ContentPlan / PlanningPhaseResult builders for blogging tests.

Centralizes the ContentPlan construction boilerplate previously copy-pasted
(with per-file variations in topic, section count, and title-candidate count)
across several test modules. Every field a caller's assertions depend on must
be passed explicitly; only ``requirements_analysis`` and a minimal
``title_candidates`` default are shared, since every call site uses the
identical accepted/feasible/no-gaps triple and overrides ``title_candidates``
explicitly whenever it needs a different shape.
