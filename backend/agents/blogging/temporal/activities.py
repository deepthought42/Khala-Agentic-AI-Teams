"""Temporal activities for the blogging team.

The full blog pipeline is decomposed into four fine-grained, independently
retryable activities orchestrated by ``BlogFullPipelineWorkflow``:

* ``plan_stage_activity``     -> planning + story elicitation + outline approval
* ``draft_stage_activity``    -> initial draft + interactive review + copy-edit loop
* ``gates_stage_activity``    -> validators + fact-check + compliance + rewrite loop
* ``finalize_job_activity``   -> completes the job-store entry from the final result

State crosses each boundary as a JSON-native dict (the ``temporal.phase_models``
DTOs). Every stage activity re-seeds a ``PipelineContext`` from the previous
stage's DTO and runs the corresponding stage function (shared with thread mode via
``run_pipeline``) under the shared ``_run_stage`` funnel; input-DTO deserialization
happens OUTSIDE the funnel so schema/plumbing defects fail the activity loudly
instead of masquerading as pipeline failures. Heavy imports live inside function
bodies so importing this module stays cheap and sandbox-safe.

    """Run one pipeline-stage body under the shared heartbeat + error funnel.

    The funnel is the correctness contract every stage activity must share: handled
    errors terminate the job store and short-circuit the workflow (never leaking to
    Temporal retry), Temporal-native cancellation propagates, and the background
    heartbeat always stops. Keeping it in one place makes the contract structural —
    a new stage activity cannot forget it.

    Preconditions:
        - ``body`` is a zero-arg callable that runs the stage and returns its
          serialized DTO dict; ``fail_dto`` builds the stage's FAIL DTO dict.
        - ``body`` MUST NOT catch Temporal ``CancelledError`` — this funnel handles
          it (re-raising so cancellation propagates). Swallowing it in ``body`` would
          convert an external cancellation into a spurious FAIL. A best-effort
          backstop below catches the common case where a body rewraps the
          cancellation *while preserving the exception chain*; a body that breaks the
          chain (``raise Other(...) from None``) can still defeat detection, so the
          "must not catch" rule remains a real contract, not something the funnel can
          fully guarantee.
        - Anything ``body`` does that is infrastructure setup rather than pipeline
          work (e.g. starting the job, rebuilding an input DTO) belongs OUTSIDE this
          funnel, so its failures propagate to Temporal for retry instead of being
          masked as a pipeline FAIL.
    Postconditions:
        - Returns ``body()``'s DTO on success. On any handled error the job is
          marked cancelled/failed (via ``_fail_activity`` with ``failed_phase``)
          and ``fail_dto()`` is returned. Re-raises a native ``CancelledError``; a
          rewrapped external cancellation that keeps its ``__cause__``/``__context__``
          chain is detected by ``_fail_activity`` via ``_is_external_cancellation``
          and routed to ``mark_job_cancelled`` (job cancelled, not failed). This is a
          best-effort backstop, not a guarantee: a body that severs the chain can
          still be recorded as a failure, so callers must honor the "must not catch
          CancelledError" precondition.
        - A transient LLM-transport error (``LLMRateLimitError``/``LLMTemporaryError``,
          raised only after the LLM client exhausts its own retries) re-raises so
          Temporal retries the whole stage, EXCEPT on the last attempt (or outside an
