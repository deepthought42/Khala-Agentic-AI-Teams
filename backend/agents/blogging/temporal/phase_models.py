"""Serializable DTOs threaded between the blogging pipeline's Temporal activities.

Each pipeline phase (planning -> draft -> gates -> finalize) runs as its own
``@activity.defn``; results cross the activity boundary as JSON-native dicts. These
Pydantic models give those payloads a typed shape — activities emit
``model_dump(mode="json")`` and downstream activities rebuild with ``model_validate``
(mirrors ``software_engineering_team/temporal/phase_models.py``).

Large artifacts (drafts, plans) already live under the job's ``work_dir`` on the
shared volume, so only the light state needed to resume the next phase travels
through Temporal here: the planning result, the current draft, elicited stories,
the author-selected title, and the pipeline status.
