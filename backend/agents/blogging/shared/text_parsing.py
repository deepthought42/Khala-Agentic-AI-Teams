"""
Shared LLM-response text-parsing helpers.

This is the single implementation of five helpers that were previously
duplicated (and, in the case of ``extract_json_array_from_text``, allowed to
drift) across ``blog_writer_agent/agent.py``, ``blog_writer_agent/revision.py``,
``blog_writer_agent/self_review.py``, and
``agent_implementations/pipeline/_common.py``. All four modules import from
here and hold no private copy of any of these functions.

``extract_json_array_from_text`` is the fixed variant: it resumes scanning at
the decoded value's end rather than one character past the opening bracket,
so a non-matching array that itself contains a nested ``[`` cannot be
re-entered and salvaged as if it were the real payload. Before this module
existed, ``blog_writer_agent/agent.py``'s private copy ran the drifted
(one-character-past-the-bracket) variant; its one caller,
``identify_uncertainty_questions``, now runs the fixed scanner instead — the
sole intended behavior change from the migration.

``format_feedback_item_line`` also rejects a ``bool`` index
(``isinstance(index, bool)``), tightening a precondition the two prior
duplicate copies did not enforce (``bool`` subclasses ``int``, so they
silently accepted ``True``/``False`` as a positive index). Both call sites
feed the index from ``enumerate(..., start=1)``, so no caller can produce a
bool in practice — this is a precondition tightened, not a reachable
behavior change.

``shared/json_retry.py``'s ``_unwrap_event_loop_exception`` is not a second
copy: it is a shim that calls ``unwrap_llm_cause`` and narrows the result to
that module's ``Exception``-typed retry seam, holding no unwrap policy of its
own. It previously returned ``original_exception`` unconditionally, so an
``EventLoopException`` carrying no original yielded ``None`` — which
``call_json_with_retry`` could only re-raise as ``TypeError``, losing the real
failure. Delegating here makes the guard below canonical for both.

    """Parse a JSON array of objects from ``text``, including when prefixed by prose.

    Preconditions:
        - ``text`` is a string (may be empty).
        - ``required_keys``, if given, are the keys used to recognize the real
          payload (e.g. ``("issue",)`` for self-review issues, ``("question",)``
          for uncertainty questions): at least one element of a candidate array
          must contain all of them. This rejects an unrelated dict array (e.g. a
          ``references`` list salvaged from surrounding prose) that would
          otherwise pass a bare "is it a list of dicts" check, while still
          tolerating a real payload where some items are individually malformed
          (the caller's own per-item validation skips those).
    Postconditions:
        - Returns the dict elements of the first decoded JSON array containing at
          least one dict with every key in ``required_keys``, found by scanning
          for ``[`` and using ``json.JSONDecoder.raw_decode``. Non-dict elements
          in that array (e.g. a stray string) are dropped rather than rejecting
          the whole array — callers already tolerate individually malformed dict
          items via their own per-item validation.
        - A syntactically valid but schema-mismatched non-empty array (e.g. a
          numeric citation like ``[1]``, or a dict array none of whose elements
          have ``required_keys``) does not short-circuit the scan; scanning
          continues past it toward the real payload.
        - If no matching array of dicts is found, returns the first syntactically
          valid empty ``[]`` encountered — this cannot be distinguished from a
          literally empty Markdown link ``[]()`` (an empty pair of brackets is
          valid JSON), so a response containing only such a link and no real
          array-of-dicts payload also returns ``[]`` here. A Markdown link with
          non-empty text, e.g. ``[label](url)``, is not valid JSON at that
          ``[`` and is simply skipped like any other non-match. Returns
          ``None`` if no array matched at all.

    Limitation: the scan looks for a literal ``[`` anywhere in ``text``,
    including inside a JSON string value (e.g. an object field whose value is
    the literal text ``"[{...}]"``), so it can extract an array nested inside
    a string rather than only a true top-level/prose array. This has not been
    observed in practice for the reviewer/uncertainty response shapes this is
    used for, but is a known edge case if a future prompt's schema puts
    JSON-looking text inside a string field.
