"""SPEC-006 integration tests: profile restriction endpoints.

Uses Postgres via the same fixture pattern as ``test_api.py`` and
``test_profile_biometrics.py``. The intake agent's LLM call falls
through to the structural merge when no LLM is reachable (per
``conftest.py``'s ``LLM_MAX_RETRIES=0``), so these tests do not need
to mock strands — the resolver hook fires on the structural-fallback
path just as it does on the LLM path.
