    sub-object onto the profile. Per-field biometric updates go through
    ``PATCH /profile/{id}/biometrics`` which uses the all-None
    ``BiometricPatchRequest`` shape instead.

    The only fields that survive unchanged are ``Optional`` ones the
    patch did not set (they dump as ``null`` and ``exclude_none=True``
    drops them), e.g. ``age_years`` and ``height_cm``.
