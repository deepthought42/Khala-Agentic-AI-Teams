    Run the full Planning workflow.

    job_updater(current_phase, progress, status_text, ...) is called to report progress.
    answer_callback(pending_questions) is used when PRA is waiting for answers; return list of
    {question_id, selected_option_id?, other_text?}.

    answer_callback / auto_answer_questions contract:
        - If ``answer_callback`` is supplied it is always used. It must not fabricate an answer
          while another round of asking the user remains available. It MAY default the questions
          left unanswered on a round its own caller has explicitly declared terminal -- the
          durable-HITL adapter does exactly this, because a bounded pause loop has to end with a
          plan rather than a hang. The price of that permission is that every defaulted answer is
          reported to the caller for persistence, so a plan built partly on machine-chosen answers
          says so where a human reads it. A callback that defaults silently is the thing this
          contract forbids; a callback that defaults on a terminal round and records it is not.
        - Else if ``auto_answer_questions`` is True (default, standalone behavior), the workflow
          auto-selects each question's default/first option and logs a WARNING (so the auto-answer
          is never silent).
        - Else (``auto_answer_questions`` False and no callback — a gated caller such as the SE /
          coding-team path), the workflow FAILS CLOSED: clarification questions raise rather than
          being auto-decided, because decisions must be made by the user.

    Returns a result dict with success, handoff_package, summary, failure_reason, current_phase.
    On success, also carries open_questions/resolved_questions as their own top-level
    keys — the actual discovery questions, distinct from handoff_package's own copies
    of those fields (which are deliberately left empty; see the inline comment where
    they're set, a few lines below where document production populates the handoff).

    Preconditions:
        - ``repo_path`` names a directory this process may create and write under.
        - At least one of ``spec_content`` / ``initial_brief`` carries the work to plan;
          with neither, document production falls back to a placeholder spec.
        - ``answer_callback``, when supplied, honours the contract above.
    Postconditions:
        - Returns a dict that always carries ``success``; on success also
          ``handoff_package``, ``summary``, ``open_questions`` and ``resolved_questions``,
          and on failure ``failure_reason`` and the ``current_phase`` it stopped in.
        - Ordinary phase failures are folded into ``success=False`` rather than raised —
          the broad ``except`` below is what does that. Two exception types are re-raised
          instead, because folding them would destroy the signal they exist to carry:
          ``PlanningAnswerPauseSignal`` (a durable pause the caller must act on) and
          ``PlanningDefaultsNotRecorded`` (a defaulted answer that could not be recorded,
          which must fail the round rather than ship unlogged).
        - ``job_updater`` may be called any number of times, including zero.
