    Poll status until completed or failed. If waiting_for_answers and answer_callback
    is provided, call answer_callback(pending_questions) and submit answers then resume.
    Returns final status dict; status key is 'completed' or 'failed'.

    Preconditions:
        - ``job_id`` identifies a product-analysis job that has been started.
        - ``poll_interval`` and ``max_wait`` are positive; ``max_wait`` bounds the wait.
        - ``answer_callback``, when supplied, returns either a complete answer set for the
          questions it was handed or nothing at all — the answers route rejects a batch
          missing any required question, and every PRA question is required.
    Postconditions:
        - Returns the final status dict, whose ``status`` is ``'completed'`` or ``'failed'``.
          A timeout, a polling error, and an ordinary ``answer_callback`` exception all
          arrive as ``'failed'``; the caller cannot tell them apart from the status alone.
        - ``'failed'`` does NOT stop the caller: ``DocumentProductionAgent.run`` logs it and
          produces a plan anyway (see the note under Raises). Anything that must actually
          halt the round has to be one of the two whitelisted exception types below.
          That caller's behaviour is pinned by
          ``test_document_production_agent_carries_on_past_a_failed_pra``
          (``planning_team/tests/test_agents.py``), so a change to its fallback breaks a
          test rather than silently invalidating this paragraph -- the usual hazard of a
          contract that describes another component's internals.
        - ``answer_callback`` is invoked once per poll on which the job reports
          ``waiting_for_answers`` — not once per run, and not once per distinct question.

    Raises:
        PlanningDefaultsNotRecorded: when a terminal-round ``answer_callback`` fabricated
            answers but its audit hook could not persist them. Whitelisted through
            ``poll_until_terminal`` for the same reason as the pause signal: folded into
            a failed status it would surface only as a warning while the plan ships,
            leaving fabricated answers unrecorded.
        PlanningAnswerPauseSignal: when a durable-HITL ``answer_callback`` signals that
            no answer is available yet. It is whitelisted through ``poll_until_terminal``
            deliberately, for a Temporal activity boundary to catch and translate into a
            paused result -- folding it into a failed status here is what left the whole
            pause feature inert. A caller that does not handle it must not pass such a
            callback. Every OTHER callback error is still folded into a failed status by
            ``poll_until_terminal``, so these two are the only exceptions that escape.
            Note what that folding does and does not buy: ``DocumentProductionAgent.run``
            logs a failed PRA status and carries on producing a plan from the original
            spec, so an ordinary callback error is fail-OPEN at the system level -- the
            run proceeds without PRA. Narrowing the passthrough is therefore a choice not
            to change that long-standing fallback, not a claim that the fallback stops
            anything. Only these two types reach a caller that acts on them.
