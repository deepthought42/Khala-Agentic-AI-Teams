"""ProductOwnerAgent — ranks a product's backlog.

Flow:

1. Pull every story under ``product_id`` from the store.
2. Ask the LLM to produce *scoring inputs* (never the score itself; see
   :mod:`product_delivery.product_owner_agent.prompts`).
3. Compute WSJF or RICE scores deterministically via
   :mod:`product_delivery.scoring`.
4. Optionally persist the scores back onto each story row.
5. Return a ranked :class:`GroomResult`.

Tests inject a stub ``llm_client`` (any object with a ``complete_json``
method). In production we use ``llm_service.get_client("product_owner")``.
