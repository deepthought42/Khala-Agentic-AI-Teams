"""ReleaseManagerAgent — ship a completed sprint.

Inputs come from the SE-pipeline orchestrator after Integration runs:

* ``sprint_id`` — the sprint to ship; every planned story must already
  be in a terminal status (``done``/``completed``/``cancelled``/``closed``).
* ``plan_dir`` — the run's ``{repo_path}/plan`` directory; the markdown
  notes file lands at ``{plan_dir}/releases/<version>.md``.
* Structured failure inputs from Integration / QA / DevOps so they can
  be promoted into ``feedback_items`` for the next groom.

Outputs:

* A new ``product_delivery_releases`` row with ``notes_path`` pointing at
  the markdown file.
* Zero or more ``product_delivery_feedback_items`` rows, one per
  promoted failure, each tagged with ``sprint_id``.
* The ``Release`` model returned to the caller.

The agent is meant to be called from a non-fatal hook (the SE-pipeline
wraps it in ``try/except``), so we keep the failure surface narrow and
documented:

* ``UnknownProductDeliveryEntity`` — the sprint id is missing.
* ``SprintNotComplete`` — at least one planned story is still open.
* ``ProductDeliveryStorageUnavailable`` — Postgres is unreachable.

Anything else raised from the notes writer is caught here and folded
into a fallback markdown body; the release row is still written so the
shipping event is observable.
