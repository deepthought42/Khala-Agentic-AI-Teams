## Running via Unified API (recommended)

From `backend/`:

```bash
python run_unified_api.py
```

This mounts all 19 enabled team APIs behind one server on port `8080` by default.

## Running individual team APIs

Most team APIs can be run with `uvicorn` from `backend/agents/`.

Examples:

```bash
# Software Engineering
python -m uvicorn software_engineering_team.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Blogging
PYTHONPATH=blogging python -m uvicorn blogging.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# Social Media Marketing
python -m uvicorn social_media_marketing_team.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8010
```

For team-specific setup and env vars, use each team's README.
