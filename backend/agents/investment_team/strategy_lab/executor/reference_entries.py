"""Entry-side replay for the reference-ledger simulator.

Step 1 of the reference-ledger simulator described in
``system_design/reference_ledger_trade_model.md`` — replays
``spec.entry_rules`` over a fixed sequence of bars using the shared, pure
``evaluate_entry_rules`` (``predicate_evaluator.py``) and opens a reference
position filled at the next bar's open, matching the live engine's current
entry-fill timing (``_EngineEntryDispatcher.maybe_emit`` submits a MARKET
order on the bar the predicate fires; the fill simulator settles it at the
following bar's open).

This module deliberately implements ONLY entry-fill timing/price mechanics.
Everything else the design doc's §5 "Entries" subsection also covers is out
of scope here and left for a later step: quantity/sizing resolution
(``spec.sizing``), risk-limit admission gates (``spec.risk_limits`` —
``max_open_positions``, ``max_gross_leverage``,
``max_symbol_concentration_pct``, the ``max_position_pct`` clamp),
capital/equity tracking, the cross-symbol merged-``(timestamp, symbol)``
processing order that equity coupling across symbols requires, and the
engine-injected short safety stop. Each symbol in ``bars`` is therefore
walked independently, in ``bars`` iteration order — there is no shared
equity state yet to force a merged timeline.

``ReferenceEntryFill`` (below) is intentionally narrower than the design
doc's ``ReferenceTrade``: a full ``ReferenceTrade`` cannot be constructed
without exit data (``exit_bar``/``exit_price``/``exit_rule_kind``) and a
resolved ``qty``, neither of which this module produces. Its entry-side
fields match ``ReferenceTrade``'s 1:1 in name/type/semantics so a later
exit-side step can extend/wrap one into a full ``ReferenceTrade`` with no
renaming.

:func:`fill_entry_at` is the per-trigger fill mechanics factored out of
:func:`replay_entry_rules`'s own loop, so the combined multi-kind simulator in
``reference_simulator.py`` can fill a trigger it detects itself, bar by bar,
without duplicating the final-bar drop or the fill-bar-open guard —
:func:`replay_entry_rules` remains the whole-series, first-match-per-symbol
convenience wrapper around it.
