"""Combined multi-kind driver for the reference-ledger simulator.

Step 4 of the reference-ledger simulator designed in
``system_design/reference_ledger_trade_model.md`` — the module that finally
answers the question the whole simulator exists to answer: *given a spec's
entry/exit rules and a fixed sequence of bars, what is the complete list of
trades?* :mod:`reference_entries` and :mod:`reference_exits` each model one
rule kind in isolation, walking the whole bar series "as if the other kinds'
rules did not exist" (their own module docstrings say so explicitly). Joining
them is not concatenation: a ``scaled_take_profit`` ladder's earlier rungs
must contribute to the recorded ``exit_price`` even when a DIFFERENT rule
(a ``stop_loss`` or a ``signal_exit``) performs the position's final close,
and a position opened but never closed needs the same documented treatment
the real engine gives one — no synthetic force-close.

This module builds one :class:`RestingStopLoss` and one
:class:`RestingTakeProfitFamily` (both from :mod:`reference_exits`) per open
position and drives them bar by bar via their ``peek``/``commit``/``advance``
split, so it can compare a stop candidate against a take-profit-family
candidate BEFORE either commits, exactly the comparison the two modules'
standalone ``replay_*`` wrappers cannot make (each drives its own book to
completion in isolation). ``SignalExitRule`` has no analogous stepper object
— its own trigger check is genuinely stateless per bar (see
:func:`_peek_signal_exit`) — so this module evaluates it directly via the
same shared ``rule_compiler.evaluate_exit_rules_for_position``
:func:`~.reference_exits.resolve_signal_exit` itself calls.

Per-bar evaluation order
------------------------
Every open position, on every bar, is processed in this fixed order (design
doc §5 "Per-bar evaluation order"):

1. **Resting candidates**, once eligible (``entry_bar + 1`` onward — a
   resting order is not eligible on its own materialization bar). Both books
   are peeked; a two-way tie breaks by ascending working-rules index, the
   same tie-break ``rule_compiler.first_exit_intent_for_position`` already
   uses. Only the winner commits; the stop book's watermark advances exactly
   once regardless of which book (if either) wins.
2. **A signal exit queued on an earlier bar, due to fill THIS bar** — but
   only reached if step 1 did not already fully close the position: a
   reachable resting order beats a same-fill-bar queued ``signal_exit`` close
   (production's FIFO-by-submission-order rule), while a merely PARTIAL rung
   does not — the position is still open, so the queued close still fires
   against whatever remains, blended with any partial rungs via
   :meth:`~.reference_exits.RestingTakeProfitFamily.blend_terminal`.
3. **A fresh ``signal_exit`` trigger check** (eligible from ``entry_bar``
   itself, unlike the resting kinds), queuing a close for the NEXT bar's open
   when one fires. The moment a new signal is queued, any resting
   ``style="limit"`` stop is retired outright
   (:meth:`~.reference_exits.RestingStopLoss.retire_limit_style_rules`) —
   production excludes a resting limit-style stop from further evaluation the
   instant a competing whole-position close is chosen, so it must not get a
   later chance to win step 1 via FIFO against the now-queued signal.

Exits are resolved for a symbol before its entries are re-evaluated on the
SAME bar, and entry suppression reads the POST-exit state — so a position
that closes on bar ``i`` does not block a fresh entry trigger on that same
bar (design doc's third ordering rule). This is what makes re-entry work:
:mod:`reference_entries`'s own ``replay_entry_rules`` never re-opens a
symbol; this module's own bar walk does, by construction.

Deliberately three separate per-bar rule-decision calls, not one
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The stop book, the take-profit family, and the signal-exit check each pass
the shared ``evaluate_exit_rules_for_position`` a DIFFERENT ``PositionState``:
the stop book's watermark genuinely ratchets bar over bar; the take-profit
family's is FROZEN at the post-slippage anchor (the frozen watermark is what
makes reusing the shared evaluator's watermark-based rung test behave like a
current-bar-only test — see ``RestingTakeProfitFamily``'s own docstring for
the proof); the signal-exit check's carries the PRE-slippage entry price and
is never read by a signal predicate at all. Merging these into one call would
silently break the take-profit family's fabricated-fill guarantee — three
calls per bar is the cost of not doing that.

Cross-symbol emission order
----------------------------
Each symbol is walked independently (there is no shared equity ledger yet to
couple them — see "What this module does not model" below), and every
resulting trade is then stably sorted by ``(exit bar timestamp, symbol)``
before ``trade_num`` is assigned, 1-based, in that final order. This
reproduces the design doc's global emission order — a trade is emitted at its
final closing event, ordered across symbols by ``(timestamp, symbol)``, the
same tie-break ``HistoricalReplayStream.__iter__`` uses — without needing a
genuinely interleaved walk, PRECISELY BECAUSE no state this module tracks
(no equity, no capital, no risk gates) couples one symbol's bar-by-bar
decisions to another's. That equivalence ends the moment a later step adds
any of those: a real walk would then have to interleave symbols bar by bar
for the shared state to stay correct, not merely for correct trade ORDERING.

What this module does not model (see the design doc for the full design)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Quantity is always the nominal ``1.0``.** Real sizing needs
  ``spec.sizing``'s per-kind formulas, the ``max_position_pct`` clamp,
  whole-share handling, the risk-limit admission gates
  (``max_open_positions``/``max_gross_leverage``/
  ``max_symbol_concentration_pct``), and a running capital/equity ledger —
  none of which exist yet. ``1.0`` is the same nominal both
  :class:`~.reference_exits.RestingStopLoss` and
  :class:`~.reference_exits.RestingTakeProfitFamily` already use internally,
  and it satisfies :class:`ReferenceTrade`'s own ``qty > 0`` invariant. A
  caller diffing these records against production's real, sized ``qty``
  must not expect them to match until that layer is built.
* **``oco_bracket`` is out of scope entirely.** :func:`simulate` REJECTS a
  spec whose working exit rules contain an ``OcoBracketRule`` rather than
  silently ignoring it or modelling only some of its legs — a bracket spec
  produced no reference trades at all before this change, and a partial,
  silently-wrong model would be worse than a clear rejection. Modelling both
  bracket legs (OCO sibling cancellation, the same-bar double-touch tie-break
  where the stop leg wins) is future work.
* **No reference-side analogue of ``open_position_entry_reasons``.** A
  position still open when a symbol's bars run out — including one holding
  only a partially-reduced ladder remainder — simply produces no
  ``ReferenceTrade``, mirroring production's own treatment
  (``TradingServiceResult`` reports it via a separate entry-reason list, never
  as a synthetic force-close ``TradeRecord``); this module has no equivalent
  list to populate.
* **``simulate`` omits the design doc's ``starting_equity`` parameter.** The
  doc's signature is ``simulate(spec, bars, starting_equity,
  entry_slippage_bps)`` — ``starting_equity``'s only specified use is seeding
  the equity figure entry-quantity sizing resolves against, and sizing is not
  modelled yet (see above), so accepting the parameter here would be dead
  weight this module cannot honor. It will be added when the sizing layer
  lands; see the design doc's own "Implementation status" note.

Exclusions
----------
Per the design doc's module boundary (shared with :mod:`reference_entries`
and :mod:`reference_exits`), nothing here imports — directly or
transitively — ``trading_service/service.py`` or
``trading_service/engine/{fill_simulator,order_book,execution_model,portfolio}.py``.

    The design doc's ``simulate()`` entry point (§2), minus the
    ``starting_equity`` parameter the sizing layer would need — see this
    module's own docstring for why it is omitted for now.

    Preconditions:
        - ``spec`` is a validated ``StrategySpec`` with
          ``requires_custom_code`` False (enforced by
          :func:`~.reference_exits.working_exit_rules`, called first).
        - ``spec``'s working exit rules (``spec.exit_rules`` plus any
          engine-injected short safety stop) contain no ``OcoBracketRule`` —
          bracket modelling is out of scope for this module (see its own
          docstring); ``simulate`` raises ``ValueError`` rather than
          silently ignoring the bracket or modelling only some of its legs.
        - ``entry_slippage_bps`` is finite and ``0 <= entry_slippage_bps <
          10_000``.
        - When ``spec.target_symbols`` is non-empty, every symbol it names is
          a key in ``bars`` — an empty ``bars`` mapping does not vacuously
          satisfy this. Without this check a target symbol simply absent from
          ``bars`` silently produces no trades for it, indistinguishable from
          a strategy that legitimately never triggered; ``simulate`` raises
          ``ValueError`` instead.
        - For every symbol key in ``bars``: the sequence is non-empty,
          strictly increasing by ``timestamp``, and every ``Bar`` in it has
          ``bar.symbol`` equal to that mapping key. Validated uniformly for
          every key present, regardless of ``spec.target_symbols`` — this
          module does not distinguish an "auxiliary" symbol's validation
          requirements from a traded one's.

    Returns:
        One ``ReferenceTrade`` per fully closed position, in global emission
        order: ordered by ``(exit bar timestamp, symbol)`` across every
        symbol in ``bars``, with ``trade_num`` assigned 1-based in that order.
        A position still open when its symbol's bars run out — including one
        holding only a partially-reduced ``scaled_take_profit`` remainder —
        produces no row, mirroring production's own treatment of an
        unclosed position.

    Invariants:
        - No side effects: does not mutate ``spec`` or ``bars``, performs no
          I/O.
        - Deterministic: identical inputs always produce an identical output
          list.
        - Imports no module reaching ``trading_service/service.py`` or the
          four forbidden ``trading_service/engine/`` modules (see this
          module's own docstring).
