"""Executor utilities kept after PR 3.

The legacy ``SandboxRunner`` / ``CodeExecutionResult`` pair has been retired —
strategy code now runs through the unified ``TradingService`` event loop
(see ``trading_service.modes.backtest.run_backtest`` and
``trading_service.modes.sandbox_compat.run_strategy_code``). What's left
here is genuinely shared plumbing:

* :func:`build_trade_records` — converts raw trade dicts to ``TradeRecord``
  objects; still used by legacy test fixtures that predate PR 3.
* ``indicators.py`` — pre-built technical indicators copied into the
  strategy subprocess by the streaming harness.
* :mod:`rule_compiler` — pure-functional evaluator for structured
  ``ExitRule`` discriminated unions (issue #527). The trading service's
  bar loop calls :func:`evaluate_exit_rules` after delivering each bar to
  the strategy and emits any returned ``ExitIntent`` as a close order.
* :mod:`reference_entries` — entry-side replay for the reference-ledger
  simulator (``system_design/reference_ledger_trade_model.md``): reuses
  ``evaluate_entry_rules`` to open a reference position at the next bar's
  open.
* :mod:`reference_exits` — exit-side replay for the same simulator, covering
  all four exit rule kinds. The three resting-order kinds (``StopLossRule``
  across all four basis/style variants, standalone ``TakeProfitRule``, and
  laddered ``ScaledTakeProfitRule``) fill on their own trigger bar — exact
  level on a through-bar, worse open on a gap for a stop. ``SignalExitRule``
  deliberately does not: a bar-close predicate fills at the NEXT bar's open,
  the engine's current and unchanged semantics for that kind. Reuses
  :mod:`rule_compiler`'s trigger geometry and adds the fill mechanics that
  geometry deliberately omits.
* :mod:`reference_simulator` — the combined driver that joins the two
  modules above into complete entry-plus-exit ``ReferenceTrade`` records over
  a full backtest window: races the stop-loss and take-profit-family
  candidates bar by bar via their ``peek``/``commit``/``advance`` split,
  interleaves the ``signal_exit`` FIFO/retirement rules, and re-evaluates
  entries after each bar's exits so a symbol can re-enter after a close.
  ``simulate()`` is the module's public entry point.
