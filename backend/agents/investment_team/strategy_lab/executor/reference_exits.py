"""Exit-side replay for the reference-ledger simulator.

Second half of the reference-ledger simulator designed in
``system_design/reference_ledger_trade_model.md``, attaching exit modelling to
the entry-side replay in :mod:`reference_entries`. All four exit rule kinds
are covered: ``StopLossRule`` across all four variants (``entry_price`` /
trailing bases x ``market`` / ``limit`` styles), the take-profit family —
standalone ``TakeProfitRule`` and laddered ``ScaledTakeProfitRule`` — and
``SignalExitRule``. The combined simulator that lets every kind compete on the
same bar lives in the sibling :mod:`reference_simulator` module, which drives
the ``peek``/``commit``/``advance`` split on :class:`RestingStopLoss` and
:class:`RestingTakeProfitFamily` below directly; the whole-spec ``replay_*``
functions in THIS module still model each kind as if the others' rules did not
exist, one per-kind resolver at a time, and remain in place for their own
per-kind test coverage and for a caller that only needs one kind in isolation.

Three of the four are RESTING-ORDER kinds; ``SignalExitRule`` is not
------------------------------------------------------------------
The stop-loss and take-profit families are modeled as orders resting on the
book: they fill on their own trigger bar, at a level fixed in advance, and are
not eligible on the bar their order materializes. ``SignalExitRule`` is
deliberately NOT modeled that way — see :func:`resolve_signal_exit` for the
full argument and the two concrete behavioral differences (entry-bar trigger
eligibility, and a fill deferred to the next bar's open).

Trigger decisions and per-position rule-priority resolution are NOT
re-derived here, for any exit kind this module covers: stop-loss comes
from the shared, pure ``rule_compiler.stop_loss_triggers`` (and its
``stop_loss_level`` / ``stop_limit_prices`` geometry), and the take-profit
family's trigger decision AND its per-bar winner resolution both come from
``rule_compiler.evaluate_exit_rules_for_position`` — the same functions the
live evaluator and the post-hoc conformance gate call, per the design doc's
Reuse mandate. A ``PositionState`` whose ``high_since_entry``/
``low_since_entry`` are held FIXED at the post-slippage anchor (never
extended bar-over-bar) makes that shared evaluator's watermark-based
ladder-rung test provably equivalent to a current-bar-only test for these
fixed targets — see :class:`RestingTakeProfitFamily`'s docstring for the
proof — so reusing it does not reintroduce the fabricated-fill risk a naive
pass-through of the live evaluator's own extended watermark would. What this
module adds — and what the shared evaluator does not cover — is resting-order
FILL mechanics: which bar an order fills on, at what price, gap handling, the
stop's trailing watermark ratchet, the stop-limit arm/latch, and the
take-profit ladder's rung cursor / materialization lifecycle and quantity
bookkeeping.

Target behavior, not shipped behavior
-------------------------------------
Today a ``style="market"`` stop is detected at bar close by the live exit
dispatcher and closed at the NEXT bar's open. The resting-order migration that
replaces that is still in flight. This module models the post-migration
semantics the design doc specifies (fill on the trigger bar, at the stop level
or the worse open on a gap) precisely because modelling the current
approximation would make every stop-loss trade diverge trivially the moment
that migration lands. The design doc's own section 1 mandates this and tells
the later trade-matching module to read the interim fill-mechanics gap as
expected noise rather than a spec/engine mismatch.

Exclusions
----------
Per the design doc's module boundary, nothing here imports — directly or
transitively — ``trading_service/service.py`` or
``trading_service/engine/{fill_simulator,order_book,execution_model,portfolio}.py``.
The fill semantics those modules implement are mirrored at the semantic level,
as new pure code.

Scope limits of THIS module's own whole-spec ``replay_*`` functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(:mod:`reference_simulator`'s combined driver lifts every limit below by
constructing :class:`RestingStopLoss`/:class:`RestingTakeProfitFamily` itself
and interleaving them with its own signal-exit and entry-re-evaluation logic
bar by bar — these limits describe only ``replay_stop_loss_exits``/
``replay_take_profit_family_exits``/``replay_signal_exits`` and the
``resolve_*`` functions they wrap, not the module's classes, which the
combined driver drives directly.)

* ``replay_entry_rules`` opens at most one position per symbol and never
  re-enters, so each ``replay_*`` function here returns at most one exit per
  symbol.
* No quantity/sizing, capital ledger, or risk-limit admission gates; no
  cross-symbol merged ``(timestamp, symbol)`` timeline; no competition between
  the two families this module DOES cover and the ones it does not
  (``StopLossRule`` vs. the take-profit family vs. ``SignalExitRule``) — each
  of the three ``replay_*`` functions here models the same spec as if the
  other kinds' rules did not exist, so any of them may fire on a bar where a
  combined simulator would not have had a position left to close. In
  particular the design doc's FIFO precedence rule — a resting order
  materialized at entry beats a ``signal_exit`` close queued on the same bar —
  has no expression in any of these three functions, because no single walk
  among them ever sees both.
* The take-profit family models no true multi-bar entry continuation: this
  simulator's entries always fill instantaneously in one shot
  (:func:`~.reference_entries.replay_entry_rules`), so the live engine's
  ``entry_continuation_in_flight`` deferral is vacuously always satisfied
  here. Both it and the engine's per-rung ``scaled_partial_in_flight``
  deferral collapse to the same structural fact in this module: the bar walk
  starts at ``entry_bar + 1`` and calls ``RestingTakeProfitFamily.step``
  exactly once per bar, strictly in order, so no candidate — first or
  ladder-advanced — is ever examined before the bar after it can legally
  fire. No separate "eligible bar" state is needed to enforce that; see
  ``_LadderCursor``'s and ``RestingTakeProfitFamily``'s own docstrings.
* ``ReferenceStopLossExit``/``ReferenceTakeProfitExit``/``ReferenceSignalExit``
  are correspondingly narrower than the design doc's ``ReferenceTrade``,
  exactly as ``ReferenceEntryFill`` is on the entry side: their fields match
  ``ReferenceTrade``'s exit-side fields 1:1 in name/type/semantics so a later
  step can join an entry fill and an exit into a full ``ReferenceTrade``
  without renaming anything.

    Before evaluating any exit, the live engine appends a synthetic

    exposure but carry no effective short-side stop. That injected rule is real
    and indexable — a short that doubles against its entry closes through it,
    attributed like any other stop, at ``rule_index == len(spec.exit_rules)``.
    A reference ledger that skipped it would silently lack an exit rule the
    production ledger actually fires.

    "Permits short exposure" reduces here to ``any(rule.side == "short" ...)``
    over the entry rules: production's own condition also admits a spec whose

    custom-code specs are out of this simulator's scope entirely.

    Returned as a list so every later step derives rule INDICES from one place —

    that is still cheap to say.
    Postconditions: returns a NEW list — ``spec.exit_rules`` is never mutated —

          position still open at the last bar produces no record at all,
          mirroring production reporting it as an open position rather than a
          synthetic force-close.

    per-position rule-priority resolution the live evaluator and this design's
    own Reuse mandate specify, rather than a second, locally re-implemented
    tie-break. ``first_only=False`` asks it for every triggered intent in spec
    order (not just the winner), because a ``StopLossRule``/``SignalExitRule``
    intent could otherwise "win" the walk and mask a lower-priority take-profit
    candidate this module must still see — this class filters the returned
    list down to ``take_profit``/``scaled_take_profit`` kinds and takes the
    first (i.e. lowest ``exit_rule_index``) USABLE survivor — one whose
    resolved target is finite and positive, skipping a degenerate one (an
    unbounded ``pct >= 1`` can land a short's target at or below zero) in
    favor of the next candidate in the same list, per :meth:`peek`'s own
    docstring — which is exactly the SAME per-position (not per-rule, not
    per-ladder) firing budget as before: a bar reachable by two different
    ladders' cursor rungs, or by a standalone target and a rung, still only
    fires the lower-``exit_rule_index`` one AMONG THOSE USABLE.

    Unlike :class:`RestingStopLoss`, this object carries NO cross-bar price
    watermark — it passes a ``PositionState`` whose ``high_since_entry``/
    ``low_since_entry`` are HELD FIXED at the post-slippage anchor on every
    call, never extended bar-over-bar. This is not an approximation: a
    take-profit-family target is a FIXED price, so the shared evaluator's
    watermark-based ladder-rung test — ``max(high_since_entry, bar.high) >=
    entry * (1 + pct)`` for a long — is PROVABLY EQUIVALENT to a current-bar
    -only test when ``high_since_entry`` never moves off the anchor: since the
    anchor is always strictly below every rung's target (a positive ``pct``
    guarantees it), ``max(anchor, bar.high) >= target`` reduces exactly to
    ``bar.high >= target``. So freezing the watermark at construction is what
    makes reuse here behavior-preserving rather than reintroducing the
    fabricated-fill risk the design doc warns against (a rung that stays
    "eligible" on a later bar purely because an EARLIER bar's spike, not this
    bar's own range, once reached it) — see this module's own top docstring
    for the same argument at the module level. The only cross-bar state this
    object owns is per-ladder cursor bookkeeping (``_ladders``) plus the
    running fill/quantity ledger — the shared evaluator is stateless and is
    handed fresh cursor positions on every call.

    A fired ladder rung that does not exhaust the position's remaining
    quantity does NOT emit a closing outcome — it advances internal state
    (``_remaining_qty``, the firing ladder's cursor, ``_fills``) and the walk
    continues, mirroring the design doc's "a fired rung does not emit its own
    ``ReferenceTrade``" rule. Only the position's FINAL closing event — a
    standalone target (always closes whatever remains) or a rung that leaves
    ``_remaining_qty`` within :data:`_FILL_QTY_REL_TOL` of zero — produces an
    outcome, carrying the qty-weighted average price across every partial fill
    plus that final one.

    Invariants:
      * ``_remaining_qty`` only ever decreases.
      * Each ladder's ``next_rung`` only ever increases.
      * Once :meth:`commit` has returned a non-``None`` result, every later
        :meth:`peek` returns ``None`` unconditionally — the position is
        closed, and this object records no further fills. This is enforced by
        an explicit guard at the top of :meth:`peek`, not left to the
        caller's own bar-walk discipline: this class is used directly by the
        combined multi-kind simulator (``reference_simulator.py``), whose
        driver does not share :func:`resolve_take_profit_family_exit`'s
        simpler stop-on-first-result contract.
      * The FIRST rung of every ladder, and every standalone rule, is only
        ever checked starting at ``entry_bar + 1``: every caller of
        :meth:`peek`/:meth:`step` — :func:`resolve_take_profit_family_exit`
        and the combined simulator's own driver alike — starts its bar walk
        there, so ``peek`` is simply never invoked for ``entry_bar`` itself —
        the materialization-bar deferral for a position's FIRST candidate
        needs no state on this object either, for the same structural reason
        :class:`_LadderCursor` needs none for a ladder's LATER rungs.

    this module. The shared evaluator resolves a ``SignalExitRule``'s predicate
    at ``view.length() - 1`` (``rule_compiler._rule_triggers``), never at a
    caller-supplied index: in the live engine the view is a STREAMING one whose
    last bar is by construction the bar being processed, so "the last bar" and
    "now" are the same thing. This module's view is a
    :class:`~.predicate_evaluator.PandasHistoryView` over a symbol's WHOLE bar
    history, where they are emphatically not. Passing that full view straight
    to the evaluator would silently evaluate every position's signal predicate
    against the FINAL bar of the dataset on every step — textbook look-ahead,
    and one that raises no error and produces plausible-looking output (every
    spec would appear to exit on ``entry_bar + 1``, or never). Truncating
    ``length()`` is what makes "now" mean bar ``i`` again.

    Delegating ``bar_field``/``indicator`` to the wrapped view rather than
    rebuilding a truncated ``PandasHistoryView`` per bar is deliberate on two
    counts. It is O(1) per bar instead of recomputing every indicator series
    over a growing prefix (O(n^2) across the walk). More importantly it reuses
    the SAME cached series the entry side already evaluates its predicates
    against, so an entry predicate and a signal-exit predicate reading the same
    indicator on the same bar can never disagree within this module.

    Safety of that delegation is a property of the evaluator, not an
    assumption: ``evaluate_predicate`` reads exactly two indices — ``i`` and,
    for ``cross_above``/``cross_below`` only, ``i - 1`` — and ``evaluate_tree``
    just recurses at the same ``i``. Nothing reads forward of ``i``, so
    exposing the wrapped view's later rows through ``bar_field``/``indicator``
    is unreachable rather than merely unlikely. (The indicator SERIES are
    computed over the full frame, which is the entry side's own long-standing
    stance for causal indicators; it is unchanged here, not newly introduced.)

    never mutated.

    :func:`resolve_stop_loss_exit`/:func:`resolve_take_profit_family_exit`.

    Why resting-order semantics are deliberately NOT applied here
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    The other three rule kinds this module covers are modeled as resting
    orders — filling on their own trigger bar, at a level fixed in advance —
    because the engine's resting-exit migration makes that their target
    behavior, and modelling today's next-bar-open approximation instead would
    make every one of those trades diverge trivially the moment the migration
    lands (see this module's "Target behavior, not shipped behavior" section).
    ``SignalExitRule`` is the kind that migration deliberately leaves alone,
    and for a reason that is not scheduling: a predicate over a bar's OHLC and
    indicator values is only decidable once that bar has CLOSED, so there is no
    resting level to sit on the book in advance and no honest way to fill
    inside the trigger bar. Next-bar-open is the correct, look-ahead-safe fill,
    today and after the migration. Modelling this kind like the other three
    would therefore not anticipate a coming engine change — it would invent a
    divergence on every single signal exit, in a module whose entire purpose is
    to be an oracle the engine can be checked against.

    Two behavioral differences follow, and both are load-bearing:

    * **Eligible on ``entry_bar`` itself.** A resting order is stamped with its
      materialization bar and skipped until strictly after it, so the resting
      kinds start at ``entry_bar + 1``. A signal exit has no order to
      materialize; production's dispatcher evaluates its predicate from the
      first bar the position exists, with the ``just_opened`` gate already
      ``False`` for the market entries this simulator fills. The walk below
      therefore starts at ``entry.entry_bar``.
    * **Fill bar is one past the trigger bar.** ``exit_bar = trigger_bar + 1``,
      the only kind here where the two differ.

    Cross-kind competition is still out of scope, exactly as it is for the
    other two replays: the design doc's FIFO rule (a resting order
    materialized at entry beats a ``signal_exit`` close queued on the same bar)
    belongs to the combined simulator, not here. This walk selects only
    ``signal_exit`` intents and ignores every other kind the shared evaluator
    reports, the same way :class:`RestingTakeProfitFamily` ignores stop-loss
    intents.

    Preconditions:
        - ``rules`` is the WORKING exit-rule list from
          :func:`working_exit_rules` (not raw ``spec.exit_rules``), so every
          index is the one a fired rule should record.
        - ``entry`` was produced against ``symbol_bars``: ``0 <= entry.entry_bar
          < len(symbol_bars)``.

    Postconditions:
        - Returns the close produced by the FIRST bar at or after
          ``entry.entry_bar`` whose lowest-spec-index ``SignalExitRule``
          predicate fires and whose following bar supplies a usable fill price,
          or ``None`` in any of three cases: ``rules`` contains no
          ``SignalExitRule`` at all (returned immediately, before any bar
          walk); no predicate ever fires; or every firing is dropped by one of
          the two rules below.
        - **Final-bar rule.** A predicate that fires on the last bar of
          ``symbol_bars`` has no next bar to fill against and emits no record,
          rather than fabricating a fill past the end of the data. This is the
          exact treatment :func:`~.reference_entries.replay_entry_rules` gives
          a final-bar entry trigger, and like it the walk then ends — there is
          no later bar to retry from.
        - **Nonpositive fill-bar open.** A firing whose fill bar's ``open`` is
          not a positive finite number — or which rounds away to zero in
          production's own price bucket — does not fire on that bar, exactly as
          if the predicate had not been satisfied, and the walk continues: a
          later bar's firing may still produce a record. Mirrors the design
          doc's uniform nonpositive-exit-reference rule and the entry side's
          identical fill-bar guard.
        - The returned record's ``exit_price`` is the fill bar's open rounded
          to production's own bid-price bucket (the pre-slippage reference
          level ``ReferenceTrade.exit_price`` is defined as), its ``exit_date``
          comes from the FILL bar, and its ``exit_rule_index`` indexes
          ``rules``.

    Note the absent ``entry_slippage_bps`` parameter, which both sibling
    resolvers take: a ``SignalExitRule``'s trigger reads only the
    ``HistoryView`` — never ``PositionState.entry_price`` or its watermarks —
    and its fill price is the fill bar's own open, so slippage provably cannot
    change any output on this path. Taking the parameter would be dead weight
    with a live failure mode attached: routing it through
    :func:`entry_price_basis` would let a degenerate anchor raise on a walk
    that never uses the anchor.

    Invariants: does not mutate ``rules``, ``entry``, or ``symbol_bars``, and
    is deterministic in its inputs.
