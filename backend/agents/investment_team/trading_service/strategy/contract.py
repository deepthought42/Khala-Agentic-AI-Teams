"""Strategy-facing contract.

Strategy-Lab-generated scripts run inside an isolated subprocess and receive
``Bar`` / ``Fill`` events delivered over stdin by :class:`StreamingHarness`.
They interact with the engine exclusively through :class:`StrategyContext`,
which is a narrow, backward-looking API:

* ``ctx.submit_order(...)`` — register intent; the engine owns the fill.
* ``ctx.cancel(order_id)`` — cancel a still-pending order.
* ``ctx.position(symbol)`` / ``ctx.capital`` / ``ctx.equity`` — current state.
* ``ctx.history(symbol, n)`` — last *n* bars the strategy has already received.
* ``ctx.now`` — timestamp of the currently-dispatching event.
* ``ctx.is_warmup`` — true during the live-mode warm-up pass (PR 2).

By construction the strategy process never holds a full market-data structure,
so "peeking" at future bars is structurally impossible — there is no accessor
for future data in this process at all.

    ``BracketStopLeg``/``BracketTakeProfitLeg``), so any exit-rule kind can be
    translated into a list of these and resolved through one shared API.

    ``kind`` selects the resolved attachment shape: ``STOP``/``STOP_LIMIT``/
    ``TRAILING_STOP`` resolve to a :class:`StopAttachment`; ``LIMIT`` (a
    target leg) resolves to a :class:`LimitAttachment`. ``pct`` is the leg's
    distance off the entry reference price, as a positive fraction in
    ``(0, 1)`` (direction implied by side — the same convention as
    ``BracketStopLeg``/``BracketTakeProfitLeg``). For ``TRAILING_STOP``,
    ``pct`` is *also* the trailing distance, resolved as a ``"bps"``
    (basis-point) :class:`StopAttachment.trail_offset` rather than an
    absolute one — NOT from a second, independently-settable fraction:
    trailing-stop materialization seeds the live child's initial stop from
    the *actual* entry fill price rather than any separately-resolved
    ``stop_price``, and re-derives the offset from whatever price it is
    combined with each time it is applied (including on its bar-by-bar
    ratchet) — so a ``"bps"`` offset preserves the requested percentage
    distance regardless of where the entry actually fills (e.g. a gap),
    whereas a stale ``ref_price``-anchored absolute offset would not (and
    could even go non-positive on a large gap).
    ``limit_offset_pct`` is the ``STOP_LIMIT`` leg's secondary
    offset (a fraction of the resolved stop level, unaffected by the
    trailing case since ``limit_offset``/``trail_offset`` are mutually
    exclusive on :class:`StopAttachment`); required iff ``kind ==
    STOP_LIMIT``, the same coupling as ``BracketStopLeg._validate_limit_style``.

        The chunked harness rejects override of this method with a
        ``contract_error`` because a vectorised override would receive
        the whole chunk before the parent replays bars one-by-one,
        letting a strategy peek at later bars and emit orders tagged to
        earlier bar indices. The parent trusts ``bar_index`` for
        ``submitted_at``, so the override path would bypass look-ahead
        safety. Vectorised authors should run with ``BAR_CHUNK_SIZE=1``
        (per-bar dispatch) and implement :meth:`on_bar` instead.

        The default body is a no-op kept here so :meth:`type(instance).on_bars`
        compares true to ``contract.Strategy.on_bars`` in the harness's
        override check; subclasses that don't define ``on_bars`` skip the
        rejection branch.
