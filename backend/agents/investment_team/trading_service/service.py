"""Mode-agnostic Trading Service event loop.

Takes a ``MarketDataStream`` and a strategy code string, runs them through the
streaming subprocess harness, and collects the resulting trades and fills.

The fill simulator has a one-bar forward view (it looks at *t+1* to decide
fills for orders submitted on bar *t*). The strategy subprocess never sees
future bars — the look-ahead safety boundary is the subprocess itself, not
a convention. See ``strategy/streaming_harness.py`` and
``docs/system_design`` for details.

    A strategy-initiated close that complies with a structured exit rule at

    engine stays the single source of exit truth. This returns the closure
    :class:`~.engine.fill_simulator.FillSimulator` invokes at its
    TradeRecord exit-stamping site.

    Preconditions:
      * ``exit_rules`` is the run's structured ``spec.exit_rules`` (possibly
        empty).
      * ``views`` is the live per-symbol streaming-history map the run
        appends to each bar; signal-exit predicates read its latest bar.
      * ``position_tracker`` is the run's live per-symbol tracker (or
        ``None`` in isolation). It is consulted only to mirror the engine
        exit dispatcher's entry-bar skip (see below).

    Postconditions:
      * Returns ``None`` iff ``exit_rules`` is empty — the FillSimulator
        then keeps its no-op default and the existing fill-simulator unit
        tests are unaffected.
      * Otherwise returns a callable
        ``(*, symbol, side, entry_price, qty) -> Optional[str]`` — arguments are
        keyword-only (the FillSimulator invokes it with keywords) — yielding
        ``"engine_exit:<kind>"`` when a structured rule *fires* at the
        **signal bar** (the bar the strategy acted on, one before the fill),
        else ``None``. It does not mutate ``exit_rules`` or ``views``.

    Firing semantics: stamp on rule-fire, with no realized-return bound. This
    mirrors the engine exit dispatcher (which stamps ``engine_exit:<kind>``
    whenever a rule fires on the streaming view) and the post-#915 alignment
    gate, which treats a stop-loss / take-profit as a TRIGGER, not a hard price
    cap: a next-bar market fill can legitimately gap past the nominal
    ceiling/floor and is still an engine-owned exit. Magnitude/firing-rate
    enforcement is owned by ``ExitRuleConformanceGate``, not this per-trade
    attribution step.
      * ``take_profit`` / ``stop_loss`` (entry-price basis) — stamp
        ``engine_exit:<kind>`` (unbracketed) when the rule fires; the
        alignment gate matches these by exact string.
      * ``signal_exit`` — stamp ``engine_exit:signal_exit[<idx>]`` with the
        spec rule index, matching the engine's emitted form so the
        rule-firing-rate gate counts the reconciled close.
      * trailing-basis stops are path-dependent and deferred (never stamped).

    Entry-bar skip: a close whose signal bar is the entry bar of a
    *non-market* entry is never reconciled (``position_tracker[sym]

    Per-bar pipeline (:meth:`maybe_emit`): gate the symbol

    triggered intent (:meth:`_evaluate` over :func:`evaluate_exit_rules`), then
    dispatch by close type — :meth:`_emit_partial_scale_out` for a laddered
    scale-out rung (leaves the remainder and its protective orders working) or
    :meth:`_emit_full_close` for a stop / take-profit / signal exit (runs the
    whole-position cleanups). Shared per-bar state travels in an
    :class:`_EmitContext`.

    Splits the per-bar engine-side enforcement loop into one method
    per concern so each can be tested and extended in isolation. Holds
    the run-scoped state that used to be threaded through helper
    keyword arguments:

    * ``exit_rules`` — the spec's structured close conditions (immutable
      across the run).
    * ``engine_exit_bindings`` — ``client_order_id → entry_order_id``
      bindings consumed by the bar-loop submit step to stamp
      ``working_against_entry_order_id`` on the resulting
      ``PendingOrder``. Same map covers engine emissions and same-bar
      piggybacked strategy orders.
    * ``_next_seq`` — monotonic counter for engine-issued
      ``client_order_id``\\ s. Strategy ids are emitted client-side; engine
      ids must not collide, hence the ``e`` prefix vs the strategy's
      ``c`` prefix.
    * ``exclude_rule_index`` — the spec index of a rule ceded to a
      resting-order mechanism for this run (currently the entry_price
      stop-loss migration's entry-fill attachment: a resting ``STOP`` for a
      market-style rule, a resting ``STOP_LIMIT`` for a limit-style one — see
      ``_EngineEntryDispatcher.resting_stop_loss_enabled``);
      ``None`` (the default) evaluates every rule as today. Enforces mutual
      exclusion between the two mechanisms: the ceded rule is dropped before
      evaluation (see ``rule_compiler._filtered_intent_for_rule``), so a bar
      can never see both a resting-stop fill and a bar-close exit for it.
      The ceded rule's ENTRY-ATTACHED order is separately kept out of this
      dispatcher's resting-stop-limit bookkeeping until it latches — see
      :meth:`_scan_pending_for_gate` for why an un-armed protective child is
      not this dispatcher's to cancel.

    Empty ``exit_rules`` makes :meth:`maybe_emit` a no-op.

    ``@dataclass`` is used only for its generated ``__init__`` — it injects the
    run-scoped fields below (``exit_rules`` / ``engine_exit_bindings`` / ``views``)
    in one place rather than a hand-written constructor. This is a behavioural

        the current bar submit on the following one, for look-ahead safety) — engine
        closes built here are appended to it. The name is shared across the bar
        loop; it is the queue this emission contributes to, not a prior bar's state.

        Dedup model: the engine always emits at the position's full open
        qty and lets the fill simulator + the position-identity binding
        handle the rest. Specifically:

        * Engine orders carry ``working_against_entry_order_id`` via
          ``engine_exit_bindings``. If a same-bar strategy order closes
          the position first on the next bar, the fill simulator's
          stale-continuation guard drops the engine close before it
          falls through to ``_fill_entry``.
        * If the strategy's same-bar order is partial / clipped (FOK
          rejection, IOC drop, participation cap, REQUEUE_NEXT_BAR
          residual), the engine close sits behind it in submission order
          and ``_fill_exit`` clips ``req.qty`` to ``existing_pos.qty`` —
          residual exposure gets closed on the same bar rather than
          waiting for the rule to fire again.
        * The one explicit guard is on in-flight engine markets: if a
          prior bar's engine exit is still pending (e.g. REQUEUE
          residual across bars), skip re-emission so the order book
          doesn't accumulate redundant engine markets while the rule
          keeps re-triggering.

        Engine-emitted orders carry ``reason="engine_exit:<rule_kind>"``

        * Portfolio agrees and has positive qty.
        * ``tracked.just_opened`` is False — skip the entry bar for
          non-market fills (see ``_update_position_tracker``).
        * No in-flight engine MARKET *full* exit already pending on the order book —
          a guaranteed market close fills next bar, so re-emitting while it is in
          flight would stack a redundant market. Two deliberate exceptions keep a
          protective exit from being starved: a *resting* limit-style STOP_LIMIT
          does NOT stand evaluation down (a higher-priority take-profit / signal
          exit must still be able to fire while the stop-limit rests unfilled), and
          an in-flight *scaled-take-profit rung* market (a PARTIAL scale-out) does
          NOT stand the bar down either — it only defers the next rung, so a stop /
          take-profit / signal exit can still close the runner the partial leaves
          open.

        The single pending-order pass also derives (a) the resting limit-stop's
        ``order_id`` so ``maybe_emit`` can drop the in-flight limit stop from the
        chosen intent and cancel that resting STOP_LIMIT when a different rule
        replaces it, and (b) whether the position's own entry is still filling (a
        same-side partially-filled continuation rests) so the scaled-take-profit
        deferral needs no second order-book scan. A spec has at most one
        limit-style stop (enforced by ``StrategySpec``), so "an engine STOP_LIMIT
        rests" unambiguously means "that stop is in flight" — no per-order
        identity bookkeeping beyond the single id is needed. The id is only
        captured when ``_has_limit_stop_rule`` holds, so it is directly actionable
        (always ``None`` for a market-only spec).

        ``exclude_resting_limit_stop`` is set by ``maybe_emit`` when the spec's
        (single) limit-style stop already has a STOP_LIMIT resting: the evaluator
        returns all triggered intents in priority order and this method skips the
        in-flight limit-style intent, returning the first lower-priority rule
        instead (take-profit / signal-exit), or ``None`` if the limit stop is the
        only trigger. Because a spec has at most one limit-style stop (enforced by
        ``StrategySpec``), skipping every limit-style intent skips exactly that
        one rule. The pure evaluator stays unaware of order-book state; the skip
        decision lives here in the dispatcher.

        Already-fired scaled-take-profit rungs need no skip pass here: the
        position's ``scaled_cursor`` is handed to the evaluator, which only ever
        offers the next un-fired rung, so each rule already contributes at most one
        intent and the default single-trigger path applies.

        ``exclude_scaled`` is set by ``maybe_emit`` while the position's entry is
        still filling: a rung sized off the not-yet-settled ``original_qty`` would
        under-close (true even for a ``qty_fraction == 1.0`` rung), so scale-outs
        are deferred — but a lower-priority full-position exit (e.g. a stop listed
        after the ladder) must still be free to fire this bar, so the rung is
        skipped rather than standing the whole bar down.

        ``self.exclude_rule_index`` (constructor-set, not a ``maybe_emit`` parameter
        since it is fixed for the whole run) drops the rule ceded to a resting-order
        mechanism outright, before the pure evaluator even builds its intent — see

    relative to that price's ULP — e.g. ``pct=5.6e-17`` at a ``0.1`` price
    round-trips to an offset of ``5.6e-18``, and ``0.1 - 5.6e-18 == 0.1``

    """Resolve an ordered list of protective/target exit-leg specs into entry-order attachments.

    Pure function (no engine/dispatcher state) so the price math is
    unit-testable in isolation. Generalizes the bracket-only price math that
    was previously inlined in the bracket-only resolution path;
    :func:`resolve_bracket_attachments` below is now a thin adapter that
    translates an ``OcoBracketRule``'s two fixed legs into
    :class:`ExitLegSpec` instances and delegates here. Anchors every leg at
    ``ref_price`` independently (the
    signal-bar close, the same reference ``_compute_qty`` sizes against). For
    a long, protective legs (``STOP``/``STOP_LIMIT``/``TRAILING_STOP``) sit
    below and target legs (``LIMIT``) sit above the reference; for a short
    the signs flip. A ``STOP_LIMIT`` leg's secondary offset (``limit_offset``)
    is an absolute distance off the resolved stop level, not an absolute
    price, and a ``TRAILING_STOP`` leg's ``trail_offset`` is a ``"bps"``
    (basis-point) value, not ``"abs"`` — both because the stop level this
    attachment previews can trail/ratchet or seed from a different price by
    the time it materializes into a live child order. Materialization
    semantics (how/when each offset is re-applied) live with the
    materializer, not here; see :class:`ExitLegSpec` for the design
    rationale behind each offset's representation.

    Preconditions: ``ref_price`` is a finite number ``> 0``; ``side`` is the
    entry's ``OrderSide``; each element of ``legs`` is a validated

    absolute price is finite, strictly positive, and strictly on the correct
    side of ``ref_price``; a ``STOP_LIMIT`` leg's ``limit_offset`` is finite,
    strictly positive, and large enough to survive the side-specific
    addition/subtraction materialization actually applies to ``stop_price``,
    and the *derived* protective limit price itself (``stop_price ∓
    limit_offset``, the value materialization actually submits) is finite,
    strictly positive, and distinct from ``stop_price`` — checking
    ``limit_offset`` alone doesn't rule this out, since it's an independent
    secondary quantity; a ``TRAILING_STOP`` leg's ``trail_offset`` is a
    ``"bps"`` value in ``(0, 10_000)`` whose round-trip application at
    ``ref_price`` (``ref_price * (trail_offset / BPS_DIVISOR)``, the same
    formula the materializer applies at the real entry fill price) is
    finite, strictly positive, and yields an effective stop distinct from
    ``ref_price`` — checked as a proxy for the real fill price, which isn't
    known at resolve time. Empty ``legs`` yields ``[]``.

    excludes, by construction, the ``pct=1.0`` short-safety auto-stop

    Defaults to ``False`` — the bar-close evaluator (``_EngineExitDispatcher``

    every existing spec already runs against, including the vast majority of

    migration's remaining variants exist and the bar-close detection path is
    removed for good — a run that sets no explicit configuration keeps
    today's bar-close behavior unchanged.

    Note what changes for the LIMIT style specifically: the bar-close path
    already ends in a resting ``STOP_LIMIT`` (``_build_stop_limit_close``), so
    this flag does not change that rule's order type — it changes WHEN the
    order is placed, from the bar the stop level is detected as breached to
    the bar the entry fills. The order therefore rests un-armed on the book
    for the position's whole life, which is what lets it fill intrabar at its
    exact level instead of at the next bar's open.

    This being ``True`` is necessary but NOT sufficient for a rule to be ceded:
    ``TradingService.run`` also requires ``_engine_entry_emission_active``, since
    a run whose entries are not engine-managed (the custom-code path) can never
    attach the resting leg, and ceding there would leave the rule with neither

    (the single source of "which ``exit_rules`` entry this migration step

    attaches the resting order only when this returns ``True``, and
    ``TradingService.run`` excludes that same rule index from
    ``_EngineExitDispatcher``'s bar-close evaluation only when this returns
    ``True`` — so a bar can never see both a resting-stop fill and a
    bar-close exit for the same rule. The entry-attached order itself stays
    out of that dispatcher's cancel bookkeeping until it latches (see
    ``_EngineExitDispatcher._scan_pending_for_gate``), so an un-armed

    whether anything can attach a resting exit leg at entry-fill.

    Single source of the ``_EngineEntryDispatcher.maybe_emit`` precondition,
    shared with ``TradingService.run``'s decision to cede a stop-loss rule to
    the resting mechanism. The two MUST agree: ceding a rule the entry
    dispatcher can never attach for would remove it from the bar-close
    evaluator while nothing replaced it, leaving the position with no stop
    enforcement at all.

    The case that makes this load-bearing is the custom-code path
    (``requires_custom_code``), where the mode layers pass ``entry_rules=None``
    and the strategy subprocess submits its own entries: the dispatcher never
    fires, so a resting leg is never attached. ``TradingService.__init__``
    already applies this same reasoning to an ``oco_bracket``'s stop leg for
    exactly the same reason — a bracket only protects ENGINE-managed entries —
    so this predicate makes that carve-out explicit and reusable rather than
    re-deriving it per call site.

    KNOWN GAP (pre-existing, and not closed by this predicate): ceding is
    run-scoped while attachment is per-ENTRY-ORDER, and ``maybe_emit`` has a
    second early return this predicate does not model — a symbol outside
    ``target_symbols``. A run with entry rules, sizing, AND a symbol filter
    therefore still cedes the rule for the whole run, so a position opened on a
    non-target symbol by the strategy subprocess (``StreamingHarness`` always
    runs it) gets no attached leg while the bar-close evaluator has already
    dropped the rule. The same is true of any position the subprocess opens on
    its own under an otherwise engine-managed spec. This predicate closes the
    broad hole — the custom-code path, where NO entry is ever engine-emitted —
    but a complete fix needs a per-position signal (cede only for positions whose
    entry order actually carried the leg) rather than a run-level flag, which is
    a larger change than this migration step.

    Preconditions: ``entry_rules`` is the run's (possibly empty) entry-rule
    sequence; ``sizing`` is the run's sizing config or ``None``.
    Postconditions: ``True`` iff ``entry_rules`` is non-empty AND ``sizing`` is
    not ``None`` — byte-for-byte the FIRST of ``maybe_emit``'s early returns (see
