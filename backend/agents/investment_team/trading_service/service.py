"""Mode-agnostic Trading Service event loop.

Takes a ``MarketDataStream`` and a strategy code string, runs them through the
streaming subprocess harness, and collects the resulting trades and fills.

The fill simulator has a one-bar forward view (it looks at *t+1* to decide
fills for orders submitted on bar *t*). The strategy subprocess never sees
future bars — the look-ahead safety boundary is the subprocess itself, not
a convention. See ``strategy/streaming_harness.py`` and
``docs/system_design`` for details.
