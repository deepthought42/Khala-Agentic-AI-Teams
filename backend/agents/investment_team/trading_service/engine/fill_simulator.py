"""Fill simulator — decides which pending orders fill on the next bar.

In backtest mode the strategy has already seen bar *t* and submitted orders;
the service advances to bar *t+1* and uses that bar's full OHLC to decide
which orders fill and at what price. The strategy **does not** have access
to bar *t+1* until after its ``on_fill`` events have been delivered.

The trigger geometry and the (price, qty, slippage) triple per order live
behind a pluggable ``ExecutionModel`` (issue #248). Two implementations
ship: ``OptimisticExecutionModel`` (legacy, used by golden parity tests)
and ``RealisticExecutionModel`` (default; limit fills at limit price,
participation-capped partial fills, adverse-selection haircut).

Transaction costs and realized P&L on close match the legacy
``TradeSimulationEngine._close_position`` math so parity tests hold.

        cheaply for the common non-trailing case so golden-parity
        strategies pay nothing.

        Ratchet direction is governed by the *protected position*, not

        * SHORT TRAILING_STOP closes a LONG → water tracks ``bar.high``

        * LONG TRAILING_STOP closes a SHORT → water tracks ``bar.low``
          and ``eff_stop`` sits ``offset`` above it.

        An adverse bar leaves prior state untouched (ratchet only moves
        favorably).

           ``validate_prices`` should have rejected a TRAILING_STOP

        Shared by the fixed ``attached_stop_loss`` bracket field and each
        ``StopAttachment`` entry in ``attached_exits`` — the STOP /
        STOP_LIMIT / TRAILING_STOP shaping, submission, and trailing-water
        pre-seed are identical regardless of which field the leg came from.

        Preconditions: ``po.request is req``; ``entry_fill_price`` is
        ``Optional[float]`` in the type signature, but per the caller's own
        guarantee (``_materialize_attached_exit_children``: "``pos`` is
        guaranteed to exist whenever this method runs") it is always the
        parent's actual fill price in every real call path, never ``None`` —
        the ``is not None`` checks below are defense-in-depth against the
        type, not a case this method expects to hit. Used to pre-seed a
        trailing leg's ratchet and, when ``sl.entry_price_pct`` is set, to
        re-anchor the resting child's ``stop_price`` (see
        :class:`StopAttachment`). ``child_side`` must be the position-closing
        side opposite ``req.side`` (SHORT child for a LONG parent, LONG child
        for a SHORT parent) — the stop/limit geometry below is derived from
        ``req.side``, never from ``child_side``.
        Postconditions: exactly one resting STOP/STOP_LIMIT/TRAILING_STOP
        child is submitted to the order book, tagged with ``oco_group_id``
        and ``parent_order_id=po.order_id``.
        Invariant: the child's ``stop_price`` and (for a STOP_LIMIT)
        ``limit_price`` are always derived from one anchor — the parent's
        actual fill price when ``sl.entry_price_pct`` is set, the
        emission-time preview otherwise. ``sl.entry_price_limit_offset_pct``
        is what carries that anchor through to the limit side; validation
        (``OrderRequest.validate_prices``) requires it whenever a re-anchoring
        leg is also a STOP_LIMIT, so the two prices cannot diverge.
        When ``events`` is provided and
        ``sl.entry_price_pct`` is set (the resting entry_price
        stop-loss migration's exclusive marker — see ``StopAttachment``),
        an ``"engine_exit_attached"`` diagnostic event is appended so the
        firing-count telemetry credits this resting leg at materialization
        time, mirroring the bar-close evaluator's own emission-time credit
        (``_record_emission`` in ``trading_service.service``) — see

        """Run queued stop-loss fallback retirements.

        The invariant is not "after the fill loop" but the narrower **never
        while a fill loop is iterating** — ``process_bar`` calls this at two
        points (before its snapshot and after the loop) and both satisfy that.
        Deferring out of the loop — after ``process_bar``'s fill loop — is
        load-bearing, not tidiness. That loop iterates a snapshot but skips any
        order no longer in the book (``if po.order_id not in self.order_book``),
        so cancelling a fallback mid-loop destroys its fill opportunity for the
        CURRENT bar. The replacement child cannot take over on that bar either:
        it is absent from the snapshot, and the engine-internal same-bar guard
        (``working_against_entry_order_id`` set with ``submitted_at`` not
        strictly earlier) skips it until the next one. So an immediate cancel on
        a bar that crossed the fallback's stop AND limit would leave the position
        open through a stop it had already triggered.

        Running here instead, the fallback keeps its turn: if the bar filled it,
        the position is closed and the queue entry finds nothing left to cancel;
        if it did not fill, it is retired and the correctly-anchored attachment
        takes over from the next bar.

        Two scopes decide WHICH queued retirements run, because the queue is
        global while the thing that grants a fill opportunity — ``process_bar``
        — is per (symbol, bar).

        ``symbol`` is the hard one. ``expire_day_orders`` expires DAY orders
        order-book-WIDE and materializes a replacement for every partially
        filled parent it finds, so at a rollover it can queue retirements for
        several symbols at once, before ANY of their fill loops have run. A
        drain that ignored symbol would let the first symbol processed cancel
        the others' fallbacks; worse, those replacements carry the FIRST
        symbol's bar timestamp, so when a same-timestamp bar for one of them
        arrives its child is skipped by the same-bar guard too — fallback gone,
        replacement ineligible, position open through a triggered stop. So a
        retirement is applied only inside its own symbol's ``process_bar``.
        (An entry whose symbol never gets another bar simply stays queued; the
        orders it would cancel are moot once the run ends.)

        ``before_bar`` is the temporal scope, and exists because the queue has
        two producers on opposite sides of a bar's fill loop:

        * ``None`` (the post-loop call) drains everything. Every entry present
          was queued for this bar, and the loop it was waiting on is done.
        * A bar timestamp (the pre-loop call) drains only entries queued for a
          STRICTLY EARLIER bar — retirements a mid-loop raise stranded. Note the
          reason this is safe is NOT that the fallback had its turn: the raise can
          abort the loop before the fallback's place in the snapshot. It is that
          the replacement child's ``submitted_at`` is now strictly earlier, so the
          same-bar guard no longer skips it and it protects the position from this
          bar on — the fallback is redundant whether or not it was examined, and
          the aborted bar was lost to the raise regardless. Entries queued for this
          bar are held back: ``expire_day_orders`` runs before
          ``process_bar(cur_bar)``, so its retirement targets a fallback that is
          about to appear in this bar's snapshot and has NOT had its turn.
          Draining it here would destroy that turn while the replacement child,
          stamped with this bar's timestamp, is skipped by the engine-internal
          same-bar guard until the next one — the position left open through a
          stop it had already triggered.

        The window this closes: while an entry is only PARTIALLY filled it has no
        attached protection yet (materialization waits for the terminal slice so
        the children size to the cumulative position), so the bar-close evaluator
        stays live for the rule and may emit its own resting close if the level is
        breached. A ``style="limit"`` close deliberately does NOT cancel entry
        continuations — it may gap through unfilled, so stripping the scale-in
        would be wrong — meaning the entry can go on to complete and materialize
        the attached leg alongside that fallback. Two full-position protective
        orders would then rest at DIFFERENT anchors (the fallback on the partial
        position's entry price, this leg on the cumulative fill price), and
        ``_scan_pending_for_gate`` records only one id, so a replacement close
        would cancel one while the other could still fill first and pre-empt it.

        This leg is the authoritative one — correctly anchored on the cumulative
        fill and sized to ``pos.original_qty`` — so the fallback is retired rather
        than reused. The position is never momentarily unprotected: the child is
        submitted before this runs, and the fallback keeps working until the end
        of the bar.

        The predicate targets the fallback exactly: a dispatcher emission has no
        ``parent_order_id`` (``OrderBook.submit`` rejects one), whereas every
