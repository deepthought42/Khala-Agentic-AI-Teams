"""Fill simulator — decides which pending orders fill on the next bar.

In backtest mode the strategy has already seen bar *t* and submitted orders;
the service advances to bar *t+1* and uses that bar's full OHLC to decide
which orders fill and at what price. The strategy **does not** have access
to bar *t+1* until after its ``on_fill`` events have been delivered.

The trigger geometry and the (price, qty, slippage) triple per order live
behind a pluggable ``ExecutionModel`` (issue #248). Two implementations
ship: ``OptimisticExecutionModel`` (legacy, used by golden parity tests)
and ``RealisticExecutionModel`` (default; limit fills at limit price,
participation-capped partial fills, adverse-selection haircut).

Transaction costs and realized P&L on close match the legacy
``TradeSimulationEngine._close_position`` math so parity tests hold.
