"""Pending-order book.

The ``OrderBook`` is the authoritative record of *accepted* strategy orders.
Strategy-emitted ``OrderRequest`` records come in through
:meth:`OrderBook.submit`, get gated by the existing
:class:`~investment_team.execution.risk_filter.RiskFilter`, receive an engine
``order_id``, and sit here until the :class:`FillSimulator` decides to fill
them (or they expire by TIF, or the strategy cancels them).
