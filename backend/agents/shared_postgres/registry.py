"""Central registry of team Postgres schema modules.

Analogue of ``shared_temporal/teams_registry.py``. Each entry maps a
team slug to the dotted path of a module that exports ``SCHEMA:
TeamSchema``. ``register_all_team_schemas`` imports each module lazily
and applies its schema; it is not wired into the ``unified_api``
lifespan (teams run in their own containers and register themselves),
but is useful for CLI migrations, tests, and standalone harnesses.
