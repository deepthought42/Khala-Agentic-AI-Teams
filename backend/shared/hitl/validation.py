"""Answer-submission validation for pending HITL questions.

The reconciled, strictest union of the rule sets both teams historically carried:
coding_team's ``_validate_answers`` already implemented every rule here; SE's
inline route validation was missing the corrupted-record guard and the
duplicate-answer rejection. This is the single owner of that logic.

    """Validate submitted answers against a job's pending questions; return them as plain dicts.

    Preconditions:
        - ``data`` is the job record; a valid submission requires it to be
          ``waiting_for_answers`` with a non-empty, well-formed ``pending_questions``
          list (each entry a dict carrying an ``id``).
        - ``request`` is the parsed :class:`SubmitAnswersRequest`.
    Postconditions:
        - Raises ``HTTPException`` 400 if the job is not waiting, has no pending
          questions, any required question is unanswered, two answers target the
          same question, an answer references an unknown question, or an answer is
          not a decision ('other' selected without non-blank text, a non-'other'
          option the question never offered, or neither an option nor text).
        - Raises ``HTTPException`` **500** if a pending question is missing its
          ``id`` — that is a corrupted server-side record, not bad client input,
          so it is surfaced as a controlled server error rather than a bare
          ``KeyError``.
        - Otherwise returns the answers as dicts ready for the job store, each
          carrying the ``question_text`` of the pending question it answers (so a
          later resume can match answers to re-asked questions by text). Each dict
          is ``{question_id, question_text, selected_option_id, other_text}`` with
          ``other_text`` returned raw (un-stripped).

    ``HTTPException`` is imported HERE rather than at module scope so that
    importing ``shared.hitl`` does not drag ``fastapi`` (and through it
    starlette/anyio/sniffio) into every consumer's import graph. That matters
    beyond tidiness: this package is imported by Temporal workflow code, and the
    temporalio sandbox re-imports a workflow module's parent packages before the
    module itself. Executing fastapi's import chain inside that sandbox fails
    with "Restriction state not present. Using subclasses of proxied objects is
    unsupported." It is the same principle ``shared/hitl/testing.py`` already
    documents for keeping ``temporalio`` out of this package's transitive graph,
    applied in the other direction. After the first call the import is a
    ``sys.modules`` lookup, so the cost is a dict hit per invocation.
