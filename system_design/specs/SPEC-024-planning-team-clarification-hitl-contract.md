## 1. Problem Statement

`planning_team` can surface clarification questions (`OpenQuestion` /
`backend/agents/planning_team/models.py:216-244`) but has no way to actually pause a running job
and wait for a human to answer one. `resolve_pra_answers()`
(`backend/agents/planning_team/orchestrator.py:45-81`) always auto-picks the `is_default` (or
first) option whenever no `answer_callback` is supplied — and every call site, in both thread mode
(`orchestrator.py` `run_workflow`) and Temporal mode (`temporal/activities.py:320-324`,
`document_production_activity`), calls it with `auto_answer_questions=True` and no callback. A
stub answers route already exists (`api/main.py:389-424`, `POST /{job_id}/answers`) but always
returns `400`, because nothing ever sets `waiting_for_answers=True` on a Planning job record.

Temporal activities cannot natively suspend mid-execution for an arbitrary human response time —
only a *workflow* can await a signal. So before any implementation work starts, this story fixes
the shape of the solution: what the activity returns when it needs input, what the workflow waits
on, what the human's answer looks like on the wire, and how re-invocation is made idempotent.

The coding team already solved this exact problem for its own Tech-Lead clarification loop
(`SPEC-023-coding-team-human-in-the-loop.md`, `backend/agents/software_engineering_team/hitl.py`,
`pause_cycle.py`, `temporal/coding_team_workflow.py`). SPEC-023 §4.3.3 and §7 explicitly deferred
Planning's Temporal-mode pause semantics as future work. This spec is that follow-up, and its
central design decision is: **reuse that signal/pause-cycle workflow state-machine pattern
verbatim, extending only the payload fields Planning needs, rather than inventing a second one**
(§4.1 spells out exactly which payload fields are extended and why "verbatim" here scopes to the
state machine, not to the payload bytes).

`PlanningWorkflow` (`temporal/workflows.py`) is a plain sequential chain of
`workflow.execute_activity` calls — intake → discovery → requirements → optional market_research →
synthesis → **document_production** → sub_agent_provisioning → finalize. No `@workflow.signal`, no
`workflow.wait_condition` exists anywhere in it today.

### Reusable machinery (preserve, do not reinvent)

- `_ActivityPauseSignal` (`pause_cycle.py:36-74`) — internal exception carrying
  `{resume_token, pause_kind, pause_context, pending_questions}`, unwound at the orchestrator
  boundary into a `{"outcome": "paused", ...}` return value.
- `mint_resume_token(job_id)` (`pause_cycle.py:77-92`) — `f"{job_id}:{uuid4().hex[:12]}"`, minted
  once per pause round.
- `_check_pending_pause_reentry(job_data, acknowledged_resume_token)`
  (`pause_cycle.py:142-177`) — classifies a re-invocation as `consume=True` (token matches →
  resume) or `consume=False` (token missing/mismatched → activity retry, re-emit the same paused
  payload, do no new work).
- `submit_answers` signal (`temporal/coding_team_workflow.py:282-348`) — name, payload shape, and
  the buffering state machine (`_active_resume_token`, `_submitted_answers`,
  `_buffered_signals`) on `CodingTeamWorkflow`.
- `backend/shared/hitl/models.py` — `PendingQuestion`, `QuestionOption`, `AnswerSubmission`,
  `SubmitAnswersRequest`: the team-agnostic superset schemas, already built for exactly this kind
  of cross-team reuse.

---

## 3. Goals and Non-Goals

**Goals**
- Define the Temporal signal name and payload for delivering a human's answers to a Planning
  clarification question.
- State unambiguously which side (workflow vs. activity) owns the wait, and why.
- Define the retry/continuation shape when a clarification question is raised mid-activity.
- State explicitly how this reuses `hitl.py`/`pause_cycle.py` rather than diverging from it.
- Define Preconditions/Postconditions/Invariants the eventual primitive (#7445-B) must satisfy.

**Non-Goals** (deferred to later stories)
- Implementing the mechanism (#7445-B).
- Wiring `document_production_activity` / `resolve_pra_answers` to actually use it (#7446).
- Thread-mode (non-Temporal) pause behavior — `backend/shared/temporal/checkpoints.py`'s
  `wait_for_input`/`submit_input` already cover that path per `shared/temporal/README.md`; this
  spec covers only the Temporal-native signal. **Why this contract does not simply call
  `submit_input` from the `submit_answers` signal handler, reconciling with `checkpoints.py`
  directly:** `checkpoints.py`'s `waiting_for`/`inputs` job-record fields are a single-key
  prompt/value pair (`wait_for_input(team, job_id, key, prompt=...)` → one `inputs[key]`) — there is
  no batch-of-questions, no per-question option list, no `resume_token`/`pause_kind` taxonomy, and
  no multi-round scoping. Planning's clarification gate needs all of those (§4.1/§4.3), matching
  what `checkpoints.py` itself was never built to carry — its module docstring's own framing
  ("pair these with `workflow.wait_condition`... or, in thread-mode fallback, with a simple polling
  loop") describes the generic pattern this contract instantiates, not a ready-made
  multi-question envelope to call into unchanged. The mandatory extraction of
  `mint_resume_token`/`_check_pending_pause_reentry`/the workflow-side state machine into
  `backend/shared/hitl/` (§4.3, §4.2) *is* this contract's answer to "converge on one shared
  primitive rather than two team-specific ones": once extracted, `checkpoints.py` remains the
  sanctioned single-key/thread-mode primitive, and the new `shared/hitl/pause_cycle.py` +
  shared workflow-state-machine component becomes the sanctioned structured/Temporal-native one —
  two primitives for two genuinely different shapes of pause, both shared, neither team-specific.
- The full REST/UI surface (routes, request validation) beyond the one field this spec's contract
  requires exposing — see §4.1's `resume_token`-delivery requirement below; that field's existence
  is in scope precisely because without it a polling client has no way to learn the token
  `SubmitAnswersRequest.resume_token` asks it to echo back.

---

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 Signal name and payload

Reuse the coding team's signal **name and destination payload shape** — not a byte-for-byte
verbatim reuse of the whole pattern (§2's "verbatim" scopes to the signal/pause-cycle workflow
state machine, not to the payload bytes), since the payload requires one extension below; "reuse"
here means the same `@workflow.signal(name="submit_answers")` name and the same core envelope,
deliberately extended rather than copied unchanged:

```python
@workflow.signal(name="submit_answers")
def submit_answers(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    ...
```

Payload: `{"resume_token": str, "answers": list[dict]}`, where each `answers` element is
`AnswerSubmission`-shaped (`backend/shared/hitl/models.py:70-77`):
`{"question_id": str, "selected_option_id": Optional[str], "other_text": Optional[str]}` —
**extended** with a plural field, `"selected_option_ids": List[str]` (default `[]`), required for
`allow_multiple=True` questions (below).

**Contract requirement — a polling client must be able to learn the `resume_token` in the first
place.** `SubmitAnswersRequest.resume_token` (`backend/shared/hitl/models.py:80-96`) is where the
client *sends* the token back, but Planning's current client-facing status surface —
`PlanningStatusResponse` (`backend/agents/planning_team/models.py:120-131`) and `get_status`
(`backend/agents/planning_team/api/main.py:318-329`) — exposes only
`pending_questions`/`waiting_for_answers`, with no field carrying the token itself; the paused
activity's `resume_token` (§4.1's payload above) is consumed entirely inside
`PlanningWorkflow`/the job record today. Without a client-visible field, no caller can ever
populate `SubmitAnswersRequest.resume_token` correctly. This mirrors the coding team's own
`StatusResponse.resume_token` (`backend/agents/software_engineering_team/api/coding_team_models.py:106-112`)
— required here for the same reason. **Contract requirement:** extend `PlanningStatusResponse` with
`resume_token: Optional[str] = None`, populated (from the job record's persisted `resume_token`)
whenever `waiting_for_answers` is `True`, `None` otherwise — the client-visible half of the same
pause envelope §4.3.1 already persists server-side.

**Extending the backend response is necessary but not sufficient — the existing Angular client
must actually read and forward the token, and it does not today.** Once this route's answer
submission enforces the token check above (409 on missing/mismatched `resume_token`), every
existing Planning submission becomes rejected unless the client sends one, and today's client
cannot: `PlanningApiService.submitAnswers` (`user-interface/src/app/services/planning-api.service.ts:51-53`)
posts only `{ answers }`, with no `resume_token` field at all; `planning.model.ts` has no
`resumeToken`/`resume_token` field on any Planning-facing model to carry it through; and the shared
`PendingQuestionsComponent`'s own `resumeToken` `@Input`/echo-on-submit behavior
(`pending-questions.component.ts:103,352-359`) exists and is exercised only for the coding team's
Temporal-native pause path today — nothing wires a resume token into it for Planning's own usage of
the same shared component. Shipping the backend change alone, without this client-side wiring, turns
every legitimate Planning answer submission through the existing UI into a `409`. **Contract
requirement:** the same rollout must extend `planning.model.ts` with the `resume_token` field (read
from `PlanningStatusResponse.resume_token` above), update `PlanningApiService.submitAnswers` to
accept and forward it in the POST body, and wire `PendingQuestionsComponent`'s `resumeToken` input
from the status response the same way the coding-team path already does — this is not backend-only
scope, and the story is not complete without it.

**Correction — "wire Planning's usage of `PendingQuestionsComponent`" assumes a usage that does not
exist; Planning has no mounted question-answering surface at all today.** A repo-wide search finds
`PendingQuestionsComponent` mounted in exactly one place — `coding-team-page.component.html` — for
the coding team's own flow. Planning's own status surface,
`planning-job-status.component.html:45-47`, renders only a read-only `app-inline-banner` reporting
"Workflow paused — N question(s) need your input"; neither `planning-job-status.component.ts` nor
`planning-page.component.ts` mounts `PendingQuestionsComponent`, or any other component capable of
displaying `pending_questions` or submitting an answer, anywhere in the Planning page. A Planning job
that reaches this contract's pause has literally nothing in the browser for a human to view the
questions or respond through — every such job waits on `wait_condition` indefinitely (§5 risk 1),
regardless of how correctly the backend and the model/service plumbing above are built. **Contract
requirement, superseding "wire... the same way the coding-team path already does" above:** this
rollout must add the actual Planning question-answering surface — mount `PendingQuestionsComponent`
(or an equivalent) into Planning's job-status view, wired to `pending_questions`, `resume_token`,
submission via the migrated `PlanningApiService.submitAnswers`, and a status-refresh/poll so the
paused state clears once answered — not merely extend models and service method signatures that
nothing in the Planning UI yet calls with real question data.

**Contract requirement — carry every selection, not just one.** PRA's own `OpenQuestion`
(`product_requirements_analysis_agent/models.py:78`, mirrored in
`planning_team/models.py:224`) sets `allow_multiple=True` on some questions, and Planning's own
`AnsweredQuestion` model already has both `selected_option_id` *and* `selected_option_ids: List[str]`
(`backend/agents/planning_team/models.py:241-242`) for exactly this reason. `backend/shared/hitl/models.py`'s
`AnswerSubmission`, reused verbatim above, currently has **only** the singular field — reusing it
as-is for Planning would silently drop every selection but one on a multi-select question. This
contract requires extending `AnswerSubmission` with an optional `selected_option_ids: List[str] =
Field(default_factory=list)`, populated instead of (not in addition to, for that question)
`selected_option_id` when the source question has `allow_multiple=True`. This is not
Planning-specific scope creep: PRA's own answers-submission route
(`software_engineering_team/api/routes/product_analysis.py:283`) forwards only
`selected_option_id` today, from the same shared model — so this gap already exists for any
`allow_multiple` PRA question, coding-team or Planning. #7445-B/#7446 must land the
`AnswerSubmission` field addition *and* the corresponding pass-through at
`api/routes/product_analysis.py:283` together; shipping Planning's pause primitive without it would
build a new, correctly-plumbed pause/resume path on top of a wire format that still can't carry a
multi-select answer through to PRA.

**The client must first learn a question is multi-select at all.** Fixing the answer-submission
direction alone is not sufficient: `api/routes/product_analysis.py:194-213`, the status endpoint
that hands `pending_questions` to a polling client (Planning included), reconstructs each shared
`PendingQuestion` explicitly field-by-field and never sets `allow_multiple` — every question
serializes with the model's default, `False`, regardless of what `OpenQuestion.allow_multiple` the
question actually carries server-side. A client reading this status response has no way to know a
question allows multiple selections, so it cannot know to submit `selected_option_ids` in the first
place — the answer-side fix is unreachable without this. **Contract requirement:** the same
rollout must forward `q["allow_multiple"]` in this status conversion, alongside the
`AnswerSubmission`/validator/PRA-route changes above; all four pieces are one change, not
independently shippable.

**Every PRA question is `required`; there is no optional-question path through this contract.**
`OpenQuestion` (`planning_team/models.py:224-234`) has no `required` field at all, and the sole
producer of PRA's `pending_questions` — `convert_to_pending_questions`
(`product_requirements_analysis_agent/user_communication.py:109-157`) — stamps a literal
`"required": True` on **every** question it emits. Both consumers therefore read `True` in
practice: `api/routes/product_analysis.py:210`'s `required=q.get("required", False)` and the
answers route's `required_ids = {... if q.get("required", True)}`
(`api/routes/product_analysis.py:263`) differ only in the default applied when the key is
*absent*, and it never is. **Contract requirement:** this contract's own rules must be written
against the true invariant — for a PRA-sourced round, *every* question is required — not against a
hypothetical optional one. Concretely, three rules elsewhere in this contract are scoped by that
invariant:

- The resume-path precondition's "optional questions may legitimately be omitted" (§5) is
  **vacuous for PRA-sourced rounds**: `required_ids == pending_ids`, so a complete batch is one
  covering every question in the round. The precondition stays worded in terms of *required*
  questions (correct in general, and correct if a future producer ever emits an optional one), but
  #7445-B must not build a code path that depends on omission being possible today.
- The "submit an empty batch for an all-optional round" requirement (§4.3, step (1)) is
  **unreachable for a PRA-sourced round and must not be implemented as an unconditional empty
  POST**: PRA's own answers route rejects a batch missing any required id with a 400
  (`:266-271`), `_on_poll` never inspects the response
  (`adapters/product_analysis.py:92-97`), and `wait_for_product_analysis_completion` has no
  failure branch — so an empty POST degrades to a silent hang until `MAX_POLL_WAIT` (3600s), the
  same failure mode this contract flags for any other rejected resubmission. The requirement's
  real content is narrower and still correct: **step (1) must not skip the POST merely because the
  batch is falsy** (the `if answers:` truthiness guard) — it must POST whatever batch the resume
  round actually carries. An empty batch is not a state a PRA-sourced round can legitimately
  reach; if one is ever observed, that is a contract violation to surface, not an empty POST to
  send.
- The synthesized-default requirement (§4.3's requirement (c)) is likewise scoped to whatever
  questions a round leaves unanswered; for a PRA-sourced round that set is empty by construction,
  so the synthesis path is a correctness backstop rather than the common case.

**No `required`-default change is part of this rollout.** An earlier draft of this section claimed
the two edges disagreed and mandated defaulting the status conversion to `True` as "a fifth piece
of the same one-change rollout" — that premise was false (the key is always present), and the
change is therefore **not required**; `allow_multiple`'s serialization gap above remains a genuine
part of that rollout, `required`'s default does not. Adding an explicit `required` field to
`OpenQuestion` remains a reasonable independent cleanup — it would let a future producer emit a
genuinely optional question, which is the only world in which the omission rules above become
live — but it is out of scope here and must not be bundled in as a correctness fix for a skew that
does not exist.

**The shared validator needs the same fix, not just the model.** Adding the field to
`AnswerSubmission` is necessary but not sufficient: `shared.hitl.validation.validate_answers`
(`shared/hitl/validation.py:81-118`, the coding team's own answer-validation entry point, and the
natural one for Planning's answer-submission route to reuse rather than duplicate) checks only
`a.selected_option_id`/`a.other_text` and — at line 100 — rejects any answer where both are falsy
as "not a decision," with no awareness of `selected_option_ids` at all; its returned dict
(`validation.py:110-118`) doesn't carry the plural field either, so even an answer that somehow
passed validation would have its multi-select content silently dropped before it ever reaches the
job store. **Contract requirement:** `validate_answers` must recognize a populated
`selected_option_ids` as a valid decision, validating each id against the question's own options
**while special-casing `"other"` within that list exactly as the singular-field check already does
for `selected_option_id == "other"`** (`validation.py:86-91`) — i.e., an id of `"other"` inside
`selected_option_ids` requires non-blank `other_text` rather than being checked against the
question's stored options, mirroring PRA's own `apply_answers`
(`product_requirements_analysis_agent/user_communication.py:210-219`), which already treats
`"other"` the same way inside a multi-select submission. Every non-`"other"` id in the list is
validated against the question's options exactly as the singular check does (`validation.py:92-99`).
The validator must include `selected_option_ids` in the dict it returns. Without this, every
compliant multi-select submission — through the coding team's existing route or any Planning route
that reuses this validator — is rejected with a 400, and a multi-select answer that legitimately
combines a stored option with a free-text `"other"` entry is specifically and incorrectly rejected
even after the plural-field-awareness fix alone.

**Also reject what the wire shape alone can't rule out: plural selections for a single-select
question, and both fields set at once.** Validating each id in `selected_option_ids` against the
question's own options (above) is necessary but not sufficient — it says nothing about whether the
*question itself* allows more than one selection. PRA's own `apply_answers`
(`user_communication.py:210`) treats any non-empty `selected_option_ids` as authoritative
regardless of the question's `allow_multiple`, and resolves an ambiguous submission carrying both
`selected_option_id` and a non-empty `selected_option_ids` silently in favor of the plural list —
neither behavior is validated against on the way in. **Contract requirement:** `validate_answers`
must additionally reject (400) a submission where `selected_option_ids` is non-empty for a question
whose persisted `allow_multiple` is falsy, and reject (400) a submission that sets both
`selected_option_id` (non-blank) and a non-empty `selected_option_ids` for the same answer — the
two fields are mutually exclusive per answer, selected by the question's own `allow_multiple`, not
freely combinable by the client.

**This rejection breaks the existing shared UI outright unless the same rollout also migrates it —
both submission paths it already uses construct *both* fields on every request.**
`PendingQuestionsComponent`'s manual submit path
(`pending-questions.component.ts:397-404`) builds every submission with
`selected_option_id: selectedIds[0] || null` **and** `selected_option_ids: selectedIds` populated
together, unconditionally — "all questions use multi-select (checkboxes)" per its own comment, even
for a genuinely single-select question, where `selectedIds` still has length 1 and both fields still
populate. Its `applyAutoAnswer` path (`:301-305`) does the same.

**Correction — which endpoints this actually breaks, and which it does not.** An earlier draft
concluded that "*every* submission from this existing UI starts failing with 400." That overstates
it: `PendingQuestionsComponent` dispatches per `submitEndpoint`, and the branches differ. The
**`coding-team`** branch already rebuilds its body with `question_id`/`selected_option_id`/
`other_text` only — explicitly stripping `selected_option_ids`, with a comment saying so
(`pending-questions.component.ts:350-361`) — so it is unaffected by this rejection; and it is
today's *only mounted* usage of this component (§4.1's UI correction below:
`coding-team-page.component.html` is the sole production mount). The branches that do send both
fields onward are **`planning`** (`:340-347`, which maps `selected_option_ids` through explicitly),
**`product-analysis`**, and **`run-team`** (both forwarding `request` unchanged). So the breakage is
real but scoped to those three endpoints — and for `planning` specifically it is *prospective*,
since this contract is what first mounts that surface at all. **Contract requirement:** the same
rollout that adds this rejection must also update `PendingQuestionsComponent`'s
`planning`/`product-analysis`/`run-team` bodies (and any other caller constructing answer payloads
the same way) to send only the field appropriate to the question's `allow_multiple` — the singular
field alone for a single-select question, the plural field alone for a multi-select one — or gate
the new rejection behind the same rollout mechanism until that client change ships. The
`coding-team` branch needs no migration; its existing strip already satisfies the rule. Scoping this
correctly matters because the gating decision above should rest on the endpoints actually at risk,
not on an inflated "every path breaks" claim.

**Rejecting simultaneous singular/plural selections (above) does not catch a contradictory
`other_text` alongside a non-`"other"` selection.** A submission like `selected_option_id="postgres"`
with a non-blank `other_text="mysql"` passes every check above — `selected_option_id` is a valid,
non-`"other"` option id, and `selected_option_ids` is empty, so the mutual-exclusion rule has nothing
to reject. But PRA's `apply_answers` (`user_communication.py:227-231`, already cited above) resolves
this as `selected_answer = opt.label` (the `"postgres"` option's label), silently discarding
`other_text` — while `other_text` itself remains durably persisted alongside the answer and available
to any other consumer that renders it directly rather than through `apply_answers`'s own resolution
(this contract's own resume-time conversion, §4.3, reads the raw `AnswerSubmission` fields, not
PRA's derived `selected_answer`). Two different downstream readers of the *same* stored answer can
therefore report two different decisions — one honoring the selected option, one honoring the
leftover free text — with nothing in this contract's validation ever having flagged the submission as
contradictory. **Contract requirement:** `validate_answers` must additionally reject (400) a
submission whose `other_text` is non-blank unless `"other"` is actually present in the answer's
active selection — `selected_option_id == "other"` for a single-select answer, or `"other"` a member
of `selected_option_ids` for a multi-select one; a non-blank `other_text` alongside any other
selection is a malformed, contradictory request, not free-form annotation to carry along silently.

**Duplicate ids within `selected_option_ids` must also be rejected, not silently accepted.**
Per-id membership validation (above) accepts `selected_option_ids=["postgres", "postgres"]` without
complaint — each id individually is a valid option — but PRA's own `apply_answers`
(`user_communication.py:210-219`) iterates the list unmodified: `postgres` appears twice in
`selected_labels`, and the joined `selected_answer` becomes a malformed
`"Postgres; Postgres"` that then flows into the persisted `AnsweredQuestion` and any generated
artifact built from it. **Contract requirement:** `validate_answers` must reject (400) a
`selected_option_ids` list containing a repeated id (`"other"` included), rather than dedupe it
silently — a client submitting the same option twice is a malformed request, not one this contract
should quietly correct into a different, unrequested answer.

**This must be enforced at PRA's own public endpoint too, not only in the shared validator.**
PRA's answers route (`api/routes/product_analysis.py:238-288`) does **not** call
`shared.hitl.validation.validate_answers` — it performs its own inline validation (pending/required/
answered-id-set checks only, `:258-278`, verified earlier in this section) and, per this contract's
own plural pass-through requirement above, would forward `selected_option_ids` straight through to
`apply_answers` at `:280-288` with no multiplicity or mutual-exclusion check of its own. A caller
that submits directly to PRA's public endpoint (bypassing Planning's route and its use of the
shared validator entirely) could therefore still submit plural choices for a single-select question
or set both fields, and `apply_answers` (§4.1, above) would accept it. **Contract requirement:**
`api/routes/product_analysis.py`'s answers route must either call `shared.hitl.validation.validate_answers`
in place of its current inline checks, or replicate **the validator's full answer-validity surface**
inline — not just the multiplicity/mutual-exclusion checks above, but every check
`validate_answers` performs: each plural id's membership in the question's own options
(`validation.py:92-99`, mirrored for `selected_option_ids`), the `"other"` special case requiring
non-blank text (`validation.py:86-91`), *and* multiplicity/mutual-exclusion. PRA's own existing
inline checks (`:258-278`) validate only question-level id membership (which question was
answered), never option-level validity (which choice within that question) — an inline replica
that covers only multiplicity would still let a direct PRA caller submit an unknown option id or an
`"other"` with no text; `apply_answers` silently drops an unknown id into an `"Unknown"` decision
rather than rejecting it, and the endpoint clears the wait regardless. The fix cannot live in the
shared validator alone while PRA's own route bypasses it, and cannot be partial when it doesn't.

**Why the same name, not `planning_submit_answers` or similar:** `backend/shared/hitl/models.py`
was deliberately built as a cross-team superset so both teams share one vocabulary. A single
signal name across teams means any future workflow that hosts both a coding-team-style gate and a
planning-style gate (SPEC-023 §4.3.3 flags `RunTeamWorkflowV2` as exactly this case) needs no
signal-name disambiguation. Each `PlanningWorkflow` instance is its own Temporal workflow run, so
there is no name collision risk within one workflow's signal namespace — reuse costs nothing here.

The activity's paused-return payload, symmetric with the coding team's:

```python
{
    "outcome": "paused",
    "job_id": str,
    "resume_token": str,               # mint_resume_token(job_id)
    "pause_kind": "planning_clarification",
    "pause_context": None,             # Planning has one clarification gate per job, no per-task
                                        # sub-context analogous to coding-team worker escalation
    "pending_questions": [...],        # PendingQuestion-shaped dicts, converted from OpenQuestion
}
```

`pause_kind` is a **new** value (`"planning_clarification"`), not one of the coding team's three
(`entry` / `tech_lead_clarify` / `worker_escalation`) — Planning has exactly one clarification
gate (the `document_production_activity` phase where PRA raises questions), so one kind is
sufficient; it need not fit the coding team's per-source taxonomy. `pause_context` is `None`
because Planning has no sub-task identifier equivalent to the coding team's `task_ids` — the whole
job is what's paused.

### 4.2 Which side owns the wait

**The workflow (`PlanningWorkflow`) owns `workflow.wait_condition`.** Activities cannot pause —
`document_production_activity` must return promptly with the `outcome: "paused"` dict the moment
PRA reports unanswered questions, exactly as `run_pipeline_activity` does today
(`temporal/coding_team_workflow.py:105-247`).

`PlanningWorkflow` gains the same three instance fields as `CodingTeamWorkflow`
(`temporal/coding_team_workflow.py:277-280`):

```python
self._active_resume_token: str | None = None
self._submitted_answers: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None
self._buffered_signals: dict[str, list[dict[str, Any]]] = {}
```

and the identical signal-handler rules (`temporal/coding_team_workflow.py:282-348`):
- No active pause yet → buffer the payload under its own `resume_token` in `_buffered_signals`
  (an early signal beat the workflow arming the wait).
- Active pause but token mismatch → ignore (stale/duplicate).
- Active pause, matching token, first submission → set `_submitted_answers` (the sole
  `wait_condition` predicate).
- Arming a new pause consumes any matching buffered entry immediately and discards every other
  buffered entry (bounds memory across pause rounds).

This is a **copy, not a redesign** — the state machine is proven (see the integration tests listed
in §6) and Planning's clarification gate has no property that would require a different one.

**Mandatory extraction (upgraded from an earlier "recommended, not mandated" note — see the
matching upgrade in §4.3 for `mint_resume_token`/`_check_pending_pause_reentry`):** copying this
state machine field-for-field into `PlanningWorkflow` creates a second implementation of the same
capability that will diverge from `CodingTeamWorkflow`'s on any future bug fix or race-condition
improvement to either — an unacceptable maintenance cost once both exist, not a hypothetical one.
`_active_resume_token`/`_submitted_answers`/`_buffered_signals`, the `submit_answers` signal
handler, and the arm/consume/clear rules have no coding-team-specific logic — they operate purely
on workflow instance state and the signal payload, so nothing about them resists extraction.
**Contract requirement:** #7445-B MUST extract this state machine into a shared, composable HITL
primitive (a mixin or small shared component alongside the also-now-mandatory
`backend/shared/hitl/pause_cycle.py`, §4.3) that both `CodingTeamWorkflow` and `PlanningWorkflow`
compose; `CodingTeamWorkflow` must be migrated onto the shared component in the same change that
introduces `PlanningWorkflow`'s support, not left on its own bespoke copy while Planning gets the
shared one — otherwise the extraction achieves nothing (both would still exist, just with the
newer one delegating). The contract this section defines is what the shared component must behave
like; its exact shape (mixin vs. standalone composed object vs. something else) is #7445-B's
implementation decision to make, not this design story's.

### 4.3 Retry/continuation shape

`PlanningWorkflow.run` wraps the `document_production_activity` call in the same loop shape as
`CodingTeamWorkflow.run` (`temporal/coding_team_workflow.py:546-579`).

> **Normative status of this listing.** The sketch below is the *loop shape* — the signal/wait state
> machine this contract reuses from `CodingTeamWorkflow`. It is illustrative, and the numbered
> corrections in §4.3.1–§4.3.2 and §5 are normative wherever they differ from or add to it. The
> listing has been brought forward to reflect them (the patch gate, the separately-scheduled submit
> activity, `skipped_terminal`, the durable-answer reconciliation and latch re-arm, the crash
> backstop, and result-into-`context` threading); where a requirement is stated only in prose below,
> that prose governs. #7445-B must implement against the requirements, not transcribe this block.

context = _merge_context(context, result)
```

`document_production_activity` becomes idempotent on re-entry using
`_check_pending_pause_reentry` (`pause_cycle.py:142-177`) unchanged:
- No persisted pause on the job record → proceed normally.
- `acknowledged_resume_token` matches the persisted token → genuine resume; **apply the
  now-answered questions first** via `resolve_pra_answers(..., answer_callback=<from job record>)`
  and confirm PRA has durably accepted them, **then** clear the pause envelope (never the reverse —
  see the crash-safe ordering requirement below, normatively defined in §5's resume-path
  postconditions), and continue past the point PRA raised them.
- Token missing/mismatched but a pause is persisted → this is a pre-work activity retry (e.g.
  Temporal retried the activity after it persisted-but-not-yet-returned the pause); re-emit the
  exact same `{"outcome": "paused", ...}` payload unchanged, doing no new PRA work.

**Answers must be persisted before the signal, not carried by it.** The `submit_answers` payload
(§4.1) is the *wake-up*, not the sole record of the answer — mirroring
`coding_team_hitl.submit_pending_answers` (`api/routes/coding_team_hitl.py:20-71`) exactly: that
route calls `_main.store_append_submitted_answers(job_id, answers)` (persisting the validated
`AnswerSubmission` list to the job record) *before* it calls `signal_workflow_sync(..., "submit_answers",
{"resume_token": resume_token, "answers": answers})`. The workflow-side loop in this section
deliberately drops `self._submitted_answers` after `wait_condition` returns (it only forwards
`acknowledged_resume_token`, matching `CodingTeamWorkflow.run` field-for-field) — the resumed
activity is expected to read the answers back from the job record, not from the signal payload.
Planning's answer-submission path (whatever replaces the currently-stubbed `POST
/{job_id}/answers`, `api/main.py:389-424`) MUST perform the same "persist-then-signal" write —
appending to a `submitted_answers` job-record field — before delivering the `submit_answers`
signal; this is a required part of the contract, not an implementation detail #7445-B is free to
skip. Without it, `resolve_pra_answers(..., answer_callback=<from job record>)` on resume has
nothing to read and the resume path silently regresses to auto-answering.

**The signal's destination workflow id must be stated explicitly — it is not the same prefix the
cited coding-team call uses.** `coding_team_hitl.py`'s own `signal_workflow_sync` call targets
`f"{WORKFLOW_ID_PREFIX}{job_id}"` using *its own team's* `WORKFLOW_ID_PREFIX`
(`software_engineering_team.temporal.coding_team_constants.WORKFLOW_ID_PREFIX`) — a different
constant, with a different value, than Planning's own
`planning_team.temporal.constants.WORKFLOW_ID_PREFIX = "planning-"` (used by
`planning_team/temporal/start_workflow.py:53`, `workflow_id = f"{WORKFLOW_ID_PREFIX}{job_id}"`, to
start the workflow this signal must reach). This contract's "mirror the coding team's route exactly"
framing above is correct for the persist-then-signal *ordering* but must not be read as "reuse the
coding team's literal destination construction" — an implementation that signals the bare `job_id`,
or copies Coding's prefix instead of Planning's own, durably persists the answer batch but
`signal_workflow_sync` targets a workflow id `PlanningWorkflow` was never started under, so the
signal is silently undeliverable (or, worse, delivered to an unrelated `CodingTeamWorkflow`
execution if a coding-team job happens to share the same bare `job_id`) and the workflow never
wakes. **Contract requirement:** Planning's answer-submission route must construct the signal target
as `f"{planning_team.temporal.constants.WORKFLOW_ID_PREFIX}{job_id}"` (i.e. `f"planning-{job_id}"`)
— the exact same construction `start_workflow.py` already uses to start the workflow this route must
signal — stated here as part of this interface contract, not left to be inferred (or
miscopied) from the coding-team citation above.

**Reject a stale or mismatched `resume_token` before persisting, not after.** The route must also
mirror the coding team's own request-level check
(`api/routes/coding_team_hitl.py:56-62`: `if request.resume_token != resume_token: raise
HTTPException(409, ...)`), comparing the submitted `resume_token` against the job record's
*currently active* `resume_token` **before** doing the persist-then-signal write above — not merely
relying on question-id validation to catch a stale submission. A later PRA round can reuse
question ids from an earlier round (§4.3's already-flagged `q{index}` collision risk), so a client
submitting against a stale, already-resolved `resume_token` can still pass id-membership validation
against the *current* round's `pending_questions` purely by coincidence, and — without this check —
would be written under the wrong (old) token, return success to the caller, and never wake the
workflow (which is asleep waiting on the *current* token, not the stale one). **Contract
requirement:** a missing or mismatched `resume_token` must be rejected with `409` before any write,
exactly as the coding team's route already does.

**A strict "must match the *currently active* token" guard makes an ordinary transport retry of an
already-successful submission indistinguishable from a genuinely stale one — it is not, by itself,
end-to-end idempotent.** The persist-then-signal write and the signal delivery can both succeed while
the HTTP response carrying that success back to the client is lost (a network blip, a client timeout
that fires just after the server committed). If the workflow then consumes that round — clears the
pause envelope and, per this contract's round-scoped persistence, advances `resume_token` to the next
round's value (or the job simply completes with no next round) — before the client's automatic retry
of the *identical* request arrives, the token check above now finds no active pause matching the
retry's `resume_token` and returns `409`, even though that exact answer was already durably applied
and the workflow already acted on it. A client whose retry logic treats `409` as a hard failure
(reasonably, since this contract also uses `409` for genuinely stale/conflicting submissions) has no
way to distinguish "you're too late, this round moved on" from "you already succeeded, nothing more
to do." **Contract requirement:** retain a small, durable per-token receipt (the consumed token and
the content that was accepted for it — this contract's own write-once slot, §4.4, may already be
enough of a record if it survives the resume-path clear rather than being deleted by it) so that a
request whose `resume_token` matches an *already-consumed* round, with content identical to what was
accepted for it, returns success (not `409`) — an idempotent no-op reporting the prior outcome —

**Correction — "the write-once slot... may already be enough of a record" is not reliable once §4.3's
own resume-time conversion requirement is applied; that step transforms the record this idempotency
check would need to compare against.** §4.3's resume-path conversion (the requirement introduced
alongside the synthesized-default fix, above) rewrites each raw `AnswerSubmission` into an enriched
`AnsweredQuestion`-shaped record — resolving option labels, synthesizing defaults for omitted
questions, converting `selected_option_ids` into a computed `selected_answer` string — before moving
it into `resolved_questions`. This conversion is exactly the kind of lossy, one-way transformation
this contract's own DbC discipline would flag: nothing guarantees it retains the original
`resume_token` alongside the enriched record, or preserves the raw submitted content (or this section's
own canonical comparison key) in a form the idempotency check above can compare a retry against.
After a lost HTTP success response, the "already-consumed-token fast path" this idempotency
requirement describes has nothing reliable left to prove a retry is identical, and would either
incorrectly return `409` (defeating this whole requirement) or accept the retry's content unverified
(losing the "identical content only" guard). **Contract requirement:** explicitly retain a per-token
raw-content or canonical-key receipt — the resume-path's own consumption step must persist this
receipt (token, canonical comparison key) as a distinct, durable record *before or alongside* the
`resolved_questions` conversion, not rely on the converted/enriched record surviving as a proxy for
it; the audit-facing `resolved_questions` entry can be freely transformed by §4.3's conversion, but
this idempotency receipt must not be, since it exists purely to answer "was this exact request
already accepted," not to be human/audit-readable.

while a request against an already-consumed token with *different* content is still rejected as
genuinely stale/conflicting. This is additive to, not a replacement for, the strict-match `409` above:
the 409 path still governs any token that was never valid or whose content doesn't match what this
job's history actually recorded for it.

**The token check and the answer write must be one atomic conditional operation, not read-then-write.**
Checking the active `resume_token` and then separately persisting the batch leaves a race: between
the read and the write, a *different*, faster submission for the same round can complete, wake the
workflow, and the activity can advance past this pause round entirely — clearing the envelope and,
per this contract's own permission to move a consumed batch into `resolved_questions` (§4.3's
round-scoped persistence requirement), leaving no populated write-once entry left for a slower
request to conflict against. The slower request's write-once check would then find "nothing
populated for this token" and succeed, silently persisting a stale batch the workflow has already
moved past, and returning success to a caller whose signal the workflow ignores. **Contract
requirement:** the active-token comparison and the write-once insertion must be a single atomic
conditional job-store operation (e.g., a compare-and-set keyed on the job record's *current*
`resume_token` value, not merely on "is this specific token's slot already populated") — never two
separate read-then-write steps, however narrow the window between them looks.

**This primitive does not exist today and must be added — it is in scope for #7445-B, not an
implementation detail left implicit.** `JobServiceClient`
(`backend/agents/job_service_client.py`) exposes only unconditional `update_job`, `atomic_update`
(blind merge/append/increment — no conditional guard), and `apply_and_get` (same, but returns the
post-write record); the job-service DB layer (`backend/job_service/db.py`) has exactly one
conditional-write primitive today, `update_job_if_not_cancelled` (`db.py:320-366`), which guards a
single hard-coded `status != 'cancelled'` check inside one server-side `UPDATE ... WHERE`
statement — there is no generic field-equality compare-and-set a caller can parameterize with an
arbitrary field/expected-value pair. Implementing the requirement above as a client-side
read-then-write (a `get_job` call followed by a separate `update_job`/`atomic_update` call) would
reintroduce the exact TOCTOU race this section exists to close, since nothing holds the row between
the two calls. **Contract requirement:** #7445-B MUST add a new job-service primitive narrowly
scoped to this guard — e.g. `update_job_if_resume_token_matches(job_id, expected_resume_token,
**fields)` — implemented as a single server-side conditional `UPDATE` exactly mirroring
`update_job_if_not_cancelled`'s existing shape and its `True`/`False`/`None` return convention
(write performed / job exists but guard failed / job does not exist), substituting a strict
`data->>'resume_token' = %s` comparison for that function's `status != 'cancelled'` one. This is
not a generic CAS API to design from scratch; it is the same proven conditional-`UPDATE` pattern
`update_job_if_not_cancelled` already establishes, applied to a second, narrowly-scoped guard
condition. A broad, arbitrary-field-equality primitive is explicitly **not** required — only this
one resume-token-guarded shape, which is all this contract needs.

**Mirroring that primitive's *guard* must not mean inheriting its whole-key merge semantics.**
`update_job_if_not_cancelled` merges its `fields` into the job's `data` at the **top level** — a
shallow `jsonb` merge in which passing `submitted_answers={...}` replaces the entire
`submitted_answers` value. Combined with the `resume_token`-keyed storage shape recommended below,
that is a data-loss bug, not a detail: each round's write would replace the whole keyed object,
erasing every earlier round's batch — the same batches this contract requires reading back for
terminal hydration of `resolved_questions` (§4.3) and for the per-token idempotency receipts
(above). **Contract requirement:** `update_job_if_resume_token_matches` must write *into* the
`submitted_answers` object at the round's own key (a nested/targeted `jsonb_set`-style update
server-side, `data = jsonb_set(data, '{submitted_answers,<token>}', %s::jsonb, true)`), never by
passing a wholesale replacement value for `submitted_answers` through a top-level shallow merge.
The same applies to any other multi-round accumulator this contract stores per token. Only fields
this contract genuinely intends to replace outright (the pause-envelope scalars —
`waiting_for_answers`, `resume_token`, `pause_kind`, `pause_context`, `pending_questions`) may go
through the top-level merge. **The guard must be strict
equality only — no `IS NULL` branch.** This primitive's only described caller is the
answer-submission route, which always supplies a concrete `expected_resume_token` from the
client's request; a job record with no `resume_token` persisted means no pause is currently
active for a client to answer at all, and that case must be rejected with the same mismatch
outcome as a stale/wrong token — never accepted as if it were "the very first write." Accepting an
`IS NULL` match would let a request populate an answer slot while no workflow is waiting on it,
creating a stale answer record that can later collide with a genuine pause round — exactly the
silent stale-persistence failure mode this atomic guard exists to close. (The pause-creation
activity's own "no pause active yet" write, above, is a *different* guard on `waiting_for_answers`,
not this primitive, and is unaffected by this correction.)

**The `resume_token` match alone is not enough either — the job's own SQL `status` must be part of
the same guard.** A job can be cancelled, interrupted, or otherwise reach a terminal status while
its pause envelope and `resume_token` are still sitting in the record unchanged (nothing in this
contract clears the envelope on cancellation — that is a separate, `pause_kind`-agnostic path).
With a token-only predicate, a client holding that still-matching token can persist an answer batch
and receive success, then signal a workflow execution that Temporal has already terminated —
succeeding at the store layer for a round that no longer exists at the workflow layer. **Contract
requirement:** the same conditional `UPDATE` must additionally guard on the job's top-level SQL
`status` column being active — `status IN ('pending', 'running')`, the same allowlist and the same
"real SQL column, not `data->>'status'`" correction as the pause-creation primitive above (§4.3) —
so terminalization and answer-submission cannot race past each other: the status check must be
part of the one atomic server-side `UPDATE`, not a separate check before or after it, or the two
could still interleave.

**The `resume_token`-match guard alone is not write-once — it must also condition on the
token-scoped answer slot itself.** `resume_token` does not change when an answer batch is written
for it, so under two concurrent submissions for the *same* active token, `WHERE resume_token =
expected_resume_token` is satisfied by **both** requests: the first write does not invalidate the
guard for the second, and the second silently overwrites the first's answer content — the exact
last-write-wins outcome the first-write-wins requirement below exists to prevent, and it can leave
the resumed activity reading a different batch than the one whose signal actually woke the
workflow. **Contract requirement:** the same server-side `UPDATE` must add a second condition on
the token-scoped answer slot: succeed unconditionally when that slot is absent (`NULL`/unset —
the legitimate first write for this token), succeed as a no-op-equivalent when it is already
present with **identical** content (a client safely retrying its own prior write, per "a rejected
write must not strand the winner's own retry" below), and fail without writing when it is present
with **different** content (a genuine second, conflicting submission for the same token). **The
guarded slot must be the actual field this contract persists answers into and the resume path
reads from — `submitted_answers` (§4.2/§4.3, keyed per `resume_token` per the recommended shape
below), never a generically-named `answers` field**; guarding an unrelated key would leave the
real slot unprotected and let concurrent submissions overwrite the batch the activity later
consumes. This is one extra `WHERE`-clause condition on the same `UPDATE ... WHERE resume_token =
%s AND (<slot-absent> OR <slot-matches-this-batch>)`-shaped statement (keyed by `resume_token`
within `submitted_answers`, per the keyed storage shape below), not a second round-trip or a
separate primitive — the resume-token guard and the write-once guard are enforced by the same atomic
server-side write.

**The slot-matches predicate must compare the canonical key, not raw JSONB — and that key must
therefore be persisted alongside the batch.** An earlier draft wrote this condition as a direct
JSONB equality on the stored batch (`data->'submitted_answers'->%s = %s::jsonb`). That contradicts
this section's own canonicalization requirement below: raw JSONB array equality is order-sensitive
across the answer list, so a legitimate retry whose entries are serialized in a different order
compares as *different*, the guard rejects it as a conflicting submission, the route never reaches
its (re-)signal step, and the workflow sleeps forever on an answer that is already durable —
precisely the strand this section's "a rejected write must not strand the winner's own retry" rule
exists to prevent. **Contract requirement:** the write-once predicate must be expressed over the
canonical comparison key defined below — sorted by `question_id`, with each entry's
`selected_option_ids` compared positionally — not over the raw stored array. Because SQL cannot
recompute that key inside the `WHERE` clause, **the canonical key must itself be persisted** as a
small scalar next to the batch (e.g. `submitted_answers.<token>.canonical_key`, a stable
string/digest computed by the route before the write), and the predicate compares that scalar:
`(data->'submitted_answers'->%s IS NULL OR data->'submitted_answers'->%s->>'canonical_key' = %s)`.
This also gives the already-consumed-token idempotency receipt (above) the durable, unconverted
comparison value it requires, from the same write — one scalar serving both guards, rather than two
representations that can disagree.

**This write-once slot condition is specific to the answer-submission route's call — it is an
optional extra guard clause this one call site supplies, not a permanent, universal part of every
invocation of `update_job_if_resume_token_matches`.** §4.3's resume-path clear-and-consume write
(below) also calls this same primitive, guarded on `resume_token`, but it *legitimately changes*
`submitted_answers` for that token as part of consuming it (clearing it, or moving its content into
`resolved_questions`) — the incoming value is deliberately *not* identical to what is currently
stored. If the write-once slot-equality condition above applied unconditionally to every call, the
resume path's own consume write would fail its own guard every time (the slot's new value is never
"absent or identical" to its old one), leaving the pause permanently un-clearable even after PRA
has accepted the answers. **Contract requirement:** implement
`update_job_if_resume_token_matches(job_id, expected_resume_token, **fields)` with the
`resume_token` equality (and the job-status-active predicate above) as its only mandatory guard,
and add the `submitted_answers`-slot condition as an *additional*, opt-in `WHERE` clause the
answer-submission route's call supplies (e.g. an `expected_answers_absent_or_equal` parameter),
never applied to the resume path's clear-and-consume call, which supplies no such parameter and is
free to overwrite that slot as part of its own atomic write.

**The persist step must be first-write-wins, not last-write-wins.** Two clients can race to submit
answers for the same `resume_token` (a stale UI retry, a double-click, a legitimate second
attempt). The workflow's signal handler already commits to "first submission wins, everything else
for that token is ignored" (§4.2) — but that rule lives entirely in workflow memory (`_submitted_answers`,
set once). If the job-record write is a blind overwrite, a slower client's write can land *after*
a faster client's signal already woke the workflow, so the resumed activity re-reads a batch that
does not correspond to whichever signal the workflow actually accepted — the two "first" decisions
(signal-layer, store-layer) can disagree. **Contract requirement:** the job-record write for a
given `resume_token`'s answer batch must be an atomic compare-and-set / write-once operation —
only the first successful write for that token is retained; every subsequent write attempt for an
already-populated token from *different* content must be rejected (and its signal, if the client
sends one anyway, is already a harmless no-op on the workflow side per §4.2's duplicate-token
rule). This makes "which batch does the resumed activity read" and "which submission attempt
actually won" the same question by construction, regardless of which client's `submit_answers`
signal happens to reach the workflow first — the workflow's signal-acceptance order need not (and
cannot, without this) be made to agree with the store's write order any other way.

**A rejected write must not strand the winner's own retry.** The write and the signal are two
separate operations (§4.3's persist-then-signal ordering); a client can have its write succeed and
then have `signal_workflow_sync` itself fail (a transient Temporal outage, a network blip) *before*
the signal is delivered — the answer is durable, but the workflow is still asleep. If that same
client retries its whole submission and the write-once rule above rejects it outright (because the
token is already populated — by its own prior write), a client that gives up on rejection strands
the job forever: durable answer, no signal, no further retry. **Contract requirement:** the
write-once check must compare the retry's content against what's already persisted for that token
— identical content (the winner retrying its own submission) is not a conflict and must be treated
as a no-op *on the write* that proceeds straight to (re-)delivering the signal; only genuinely
different content for an already-populated token is rejected. Practically, this means the
answer-submission route always attempts to (re-)signal after the write step, whether that write
step performed a fresh write or recognized its own prior one — never conditioning "do we signal"
on "did this specific call perform the write." Re-signaling an already-applied token is safe
regardless: §4.2's signal handler ignores a signal that doesn't match an active pause and, once
consumed, ignores a duplicate for the same token.

**"Identical content" must be checked after canonicalizing, not as a raw JSONB-array comparison.**
`request.answers` is an ordered list; a legitimate retry can carry the same per-question decisions
in a different list order (a client rebuilding its request body, a re-serialization that doesn't
preserve insertion order) and still be logically the identical answer batch. Comparing the stored and
incoming values as raw JSONB arrays treats list order as significant, so this retry would compare
"different" from what's already persisted and be rejected outright by the write-once guard above —
silently dropping the re-signal this correction exists to guarantee, and leaving the workflow asleep
on a durable answer it will never receive notice of. **Contract requirement:** derive a canonical
comparison key for each answer batch — sort entries by `question_id` only (each `question_id`
appears at most once per batch, per this contract's own duplicate-id rejection, §4.1); each entry's
own `selected_option_ids` list is carried into the key **positionally, in its submitted order, never
sorted** (see the order-sensitivity correction immediately below) — and use this key for every
equality check the write-once guard performs, both for the initial write and for every retry
comparison against it.

**Correction — canonicalizing is for comparison only; the batch actually stored and forwarded must
keep the client's original order.** `selected_option_ids` order is not semantically inert the way
this correction's own wording ("multi-select order is equally not meaningful to answer identity")
claims: PRA's `apply_answers` (`user_communication.py:206-222`, already cited elsewhere in this
contract) joins `selected_labels` in the list's own order to build the human-readable
`selected_answer`, and sets `primary_selected_id = selected_ids[0]` — the *first* entry specifically,
for backward compatibility with the singular `selected_option_id` field. Sorting `selected_option_ids`
before persisting the batch (rather than only within a derived comparison key) silently changes both
of these: `["z", "a"]` submitted becomes primary id `"a"` instead of `"z"` once sorted, and the
human-readable decision text reorders to match — a real, client-visible change to what was actually
selected and in what priority, not a cosmetic normalization. **Contract requirement, superseding
"store... the canonical form" above:** the durable batch persisted and later forwarded to PRA
(step (1) of the resume path, §4.3) must retain the client's original submitted order exactly as
received — sorting/canonicalizing is confined to the derived comparison key described above, computed
transiently for the write-once equality check and never written in place of, or used to reorder, the
actual stored/forwarded batch.

**Correction — the comparison key itself must not sort `selected_option_ids` either; doing so
collapses two genuinely different submissions into "identical."** The requirement above already
establishes that `selected_option_ids` order determines `primary_selected_id` and the joined
`selected_answer` text — real, decision-changing content, not incidental ordering. If the *comparison
key* still canonicalizes that list by sorting it (as an earlier draft of this key's construction
suggested), two submissions with the same set of ids in different orders — `["z", "a"]` then later
`["a", "z"]` — produce the identical sorted key and the write-once guard treats the second as a
harmless retry of the first, returning success without ever storing or forwarding it — even though
`["a", "z"]` expresses a different primary choice (`"a"` vs. `"z"`) and a different `selected_answer`
ordering than what was actually persisted. **Contract requirement, superseding "canonicalize... (e.g.
sorted)" for this list specifically:** the comparison key must carry each entry's `selected_option_ids`
positionally — compared element-by-element in submitted order — not as a sorted/canonicalized set;
only the *outer* per-question ordering (which question comes first in the list) is safe to
canonicalize by `question_id`, since nothing reads meaning from that. A batch differing only in
`selected_option_ids` order for some question is a genuinely different submission for write-once
purposes, not an identical retry.

**Persisted answers must be scoped to the active question round, not accumulated across rounds.**
Unlike the coding team's single Tech-Lead clarify loop, a single `document_production_activity`
run can pass through PRA's `wait_pra` poll loop (`adapters/product_analysis.py:80-106`) more than
once if PRA raises more than one round of questions before completing — each `_on_poll` invocation
calls `answer_callback(pending)` again for whatever `pending_questions` PRA reports *at that
moment*. If `submit_answers` naively **appends** every batch to one flat `submitted_answers` list
and the resume-path callback naively returns the *entire* accumulated list, a later round's
callback re-submits an earlier round's already-consumed `question_id`s alongside the new ones.
PRA's own answers endpoint (`POST .../product-analysis/{job_id}/answers`) rejects a submission
containing an id outside its *current* `pending_questions`; `submit_product_analysis_answers`'s
response is not checked by `_on_poll` (`adapters/product_analysis.py:96-97`) and
`wait_for_product_analysis_completion` has no failure branch for it — it simply keeps polling,
so a rejected resubmission degrades to a silent hang until `MAX_POLL_WAIT` (3600s) expires, not a
clean error.

**Contract requirement:** the answer-submission path must tag each persisted answer batch with the
`resume_token` of the pause round it resolves (not just append to one undifferentiated list), and
`resolve_pra_answers(..., answer_callback=<from job record>)` on resume must filter to *only* the
batch whose `resume_token` matches the round currently being resumed. **Selection must be by
`resume_token` alone — never by question-id membership, not even as an "equivalent" fallback.**
The two are not equivalent when a `q{index}` fallback id (§4.3's already-established
cross-round-collision risk) repeats across rounds: filtering by id membership in that case returns
*both* the stale round's answer and the current round's answer for the same reused id, and
`shared.hitl.validation.validate_answers`'s own duplicate-answer rejection (`validation.py:56-69`,
required of PRA's route by this contract) then rejects the resulting POST outright — degrading to
the same silent-hang failure mode this section already flags for a rejected resubmission. Once a
round's batch has been consumed by a resume, it must be marked consumed (or moved into
`resolved_questions`, which `HandoffPackage` already carries — `planning_team/models.py:193-207`)
so a later round's callback never sees it again. This is the same token-scoping discipline §4.2
already requires of the workflow's signal handler, applied here to the job-record answer store the
activity reads from.

**This scoping discipline protects only Planning's own local answer store — it does not, and
cannot, scope PRA's own internal `submitted_answers` history by round.** `submit_answers`
(`job_service_client.py:811-823`, the SE team's own PRA-side primitive) `append_to`s every posted
batch onto one flat, unscoped `submitted_answers` list on PRA's job record — there is no per-round
key, and nothing ever clears or partitions it. PRA's `apply_answers` (§4.1's own citation,
`user_communication.py:210-219`) resolves each question against that entire accumulated history by
`question_id`, not against only the most recent POST. So even though this contract's own filtering
above guarantees Planning only ever *sends* the current round's batch, if a later round's question
reuses an id from an earlier round and that question is optional and left unanswered in the current
round's POST, PRA's own `apply_answers` can still resolve it from the *earlier* round's stale entry
still sitting in that flat history — a mismatch between what Planning intended (no answer for this
round's instance of that id) and what PRA actually applies (the earlier round's answer), entirely
independent of any concurrency race. **This is out of `planning_team`'s boundary to fix on its own:**
full closure requires PRA's own submission/resolution path to be round-scoped or cleared between
rounds, the same class of PRA-side gap as this contract's other open risks (§5). #7445-B must not
claim "a later round's callback never sees a consumed round's answer" as proof that PRA itself is
protected from the same staleness — that claim covers only Planning's local filtering.

**Recommended shape (decision for #7445-B, not mandated here):** store `submitted_answers` keyed
by `resume_token` — `{"<resume_token>": [AnswerSubmission, ...]}` — rather than one flat list, so
"only this round's answers" is a single dict lookup, with no id-based filtering step to get wrong.

**Mandatory extraction:** `mint_resume_token` and `_check_pending_pause_reentry` have no
coding-team-specific logic — they operate purely on a job record dict and a resume token, so there
is no reason for Planning to duplicate them or reach across a team boundary into
`software_engineering_team` to import them directly (the latter would make `planning_team` depend
on `software_engineering_team`'s internals, which is its own layering violation). **Contract
requirement:** #7445-B MUST extract `mint_resume_token` and `_check_pending_pause_reentry` from
`backend/agents/software_engineering_team/pause_cycle.py` into a new
`backend/shared/hitl/pause_cycle.py` (alongside the existing `backend/shared/hitl/models.py`)
*before or as part of* wiring Planning's contract, and MUST migrate
`software_engineering_team/pause_cycle.py` to import from the shared location rather than leaving
its own copy in place — as with the workflow-side state machine above, extracting a shared module
that only the new consumer imports (while the original owner keeps its own copy) is not the
extraction this requirement asks for. This spec does not mandate the extraction's exact function
signatures or module layout beyond the new location — only that Planning's implementation must not
diverge in behavior from what's documented in §4.4 below, and that both teams end up calling one
shared implementation, not two.

### 4.3.1 Checkpointing the external PRA run before pausing

The coding team's pause cycle unwinds a stack frame entirely internal to the activity's own
process — nothing external needs to be told "this is still the same run." Planning's clarification
gate is different: `document_production_activity` → `run_document_production` →
`DocumentProductionAgent.run` (`agents/document_production/agent.py:91-94`) calls
`job_id = run_pra(repo_path=..., spec_content=...)` to **submit a new external Product Requirements
Analysis job**, then `wait_pra(job_id=job_id, answer_callback=...)` polls it. If
`document_production_activity` is simply re-invoked from the top on resume — the way
`run_pipeline_activity` is for the coding team — it re-executes `run_document_production` from
scratch, which calls `run_pra(...)` again: a **second** external PRA job is submitted, the
original (already-answered) PRA job is stranded, and PRA-side side effects are duplicated. This is
a real gap the coding-team pattern does not have to solve and this contract must.

**Contract requirement — checkpoint eagerly, not at the pause point.** The checkpoint must be
written the moment the external PRA job id is obtained — immediately after `run_pra(...)` returns,
**before** `wait_pra(...)` is ever called — as its own atomic `update_job` call via
`shared/temporal/checkpoints.py`'s `save_checkpoint("planning_team", planning_job_id,
"document_production_pra", {"pra_job_id": pra_job_id})` (`shared/temporal/README.md`
§"Checkpoints and human-in-the-loop"). This is a deliberate change from binding the checkpoint to
the pause envelope: PRA may run to completion **without ever pausing** (no clarification needed),
so a checkpoint written only at the pause point would never exist on the un-paused path, and a
worker crash *before* any pause is reached (activity retried, or the workflow re-invokes with no
`acknowledged_resume_token` at all) would still resubmit PRA with no checkpoint to prevent it.
Writing the checkpoint unconditionally and immediately closes that gap regardless of whether this
run ever pauses.

Symmetrically — **scoped to the patched branch with `use_product_analysis=True`, the only case
this contract's PRA pause machinery governs (§5 spells out the other two cases explicitly: a
patched `use_product_analysis=False` job never creates or expects a checkpoint at all, and the
unpatched legacy branch retains its exact pre-contract `run_pra` behavior, checkpoint-free)** —
**every entry into `document_production_pra_submit_activity`** (the activity that owns deciding
whether to call `run_pra`, §4.4's split from `document_production_activity` below) — a fresh run or
a Temporal-level retry of that `NO_RETRY` activity — must `load_checkpoint("planning_team",
planning_job_id, "document_production_pra")` *before* deciding whether to call `run_pra(...)`: a
present checkpoint means "PRA already submitted for this job," full stop, independent of whether a
pause envelope also happens to be persisted; a present checkpoint makes the call a no-op. On this
same patched-and-PRA-enabled path, `document_production_activity` itself never decides whether to
submit at all — it only ever loads the checkpoint `document_production_pra_submit_activity` already
established and calls `wait_pra(job_id=<checkpointed pra_job_id>, answer_callback=...)` — the
"never call `run_pra` again" guarantee lives entirely in the submit activity's own checkpoint-first
check, not in anything `document_production_activity` decides. This makes checkpoint-presence, not
the pause envelope, the single source of truth for "already submitted," and removes any need for
the checkpoint and pause-envelope writes to be one atomic update — the checkpoint alone is
sufficient to prevent resubmission at every re-entry, no matter which write reached durable storage
last. The pause envelope's own write (`waiting_for_answers`, `resume_token`, `pause_kind`,
`pause_context`, `pending_questions`) remains a separate atomic `update_job` call, made only once
PRA actually raises unanswered questions, and continues to be read via
`_check_pending_pause_reentry` (§5) exactly as before.

Note the two distinct ids throughout: `planning_job_id` (the Planning job this activity/workflow is
running for — what `job_id`/`load_checkpoint`/`save_checkpoint` key on) and `pra_job_id` (the
external PRA job id returned by `run_pra(...)`, carried only inside the checkpoint payload). The
checkpoint must be read/written via the Planning job-store's own team namespace, `"planning_team"`
— matching `get_job_service_client(team="planning_team")` in
`planning_team/shared/job_store.py:25` — **not** `"planning"`; using the wrong team argument
addresses a different job-service partition and the checkpoint would never be visible from the
Planning job record on any later read.

This requires `run_document_production` / `DocumentProductionAgent.run` to accept an optional
pre-existing PRA `job_id` and skip submission when one is supplied (implementation shape for
#7445-B; the contract here is only that resubmission must not happen, ever, once a checkpoint
exists).

**Residual risk this alone does not close — the crash window between `run_pra` returning and the
checkpoint write landing.** Writing the checkpoint "immediately after `run_pra` returns" narrows
the unprotected window to a single in-process gap, but does not eliminate it: a worker can still
die after `run_pra(...)` has created the external job and before `save_checkpoint(...)` durably
persists its id. `run_product_analysis` (`adapters/product_analysis.py:33-48`) is a plain POST with
no idempotency key and no reconciliation lookup, so on retry the activity finds no checkpoint and
submits a second PRA job — genuinely indistinguishable, from Planning's side, from a first
submission. **Closing this completely requires PRA's own `/product-analysis/run` endpoint to accept
a client-supplied idempotency key** (or expose a way to look up an existing job by one), which is
outside `planning_team`'s boundary and this spec's stated scope — it is software_engineering_team's
endpoint. This spec cannot mandate a fix on the other side of that boundary; it can only avoid
making the gap worse and say plainly what closes it.

**A second, independent hazard in the same write: `save_checkpoint` is not atomic.**
`shared/temporal/checkpoints.py:41-51` implements it as a client-side read-modify-write — `get_job`,
copy the whole `checkpoints` map, insert this phase's entry, then `update_job(checkpoints=...)`
replacing the entire map. Two concurrent writers (this contract's own overlapping-attempt scenarios,
or any other phase checkpointing the same job at the same moment) can each read the map before
either writes, and the later `update_job` silently discards the other's entry — a classic lost
update, entirely separate from the crash window above. For this contract that means "a checkpoint
exists, therefore `run_pra` already ran" is **not** guaranteed by the checkpoint write alone: an
attempt whose checkpoint entry was clobbered by a concurrent map-replacing write finds no checkpoint
on re-entry and submits a second external PRA job — the very duplicate-submission outcome the
checkpoint exists to prevent, reached without any crash. **Contract requirement:** #7445-B must not
rely on `save_checkpoint`'s current shape for this guarantee. Either (a) write the `pra_job_id`
through a primitive that updates only its own key server-side (a targeted nested/merge update, or a
conditional `UPDATE` in the same family as this contract's other guarded writes) rather than
replacing the whole `checkpoints` map client-side, or (b) persist this contract's PRA-job id as its
own top-level job-record field written by a single-key update, using `save_checkpoint` only as a
non-authoritative convenience mirror. Whichever shape is chosen, the durable record this contract's
"never resubmit once a checkpoint exists" invariant reads must be written by an operation that
cannot lose a concurrent writer's update; a read-modify-write over a shared map does not qualify.
This is a `planning_team`/shared-infra-side gap — unlike the idempotency-key gap above it does **not**
require any PRA change — so it is a requirement here, not an open risk.

**Contract requirement given that constraint:** until PRA supports an idempotency key, the PRA
*submission* itself (`run_pra(...)` through the eager `save_checkpoint` write, and nothing else)
must be its own **separately-scheduled Temporal activity**, executed via its own
`workflow.execute_activity(..., retry_policy=NO_RETRY)` call — not the bounded/default retry
policy recommended below for the rest of the activity. This must be a genuinely distinct
`execute_activity` invocation, not an in-process "do not retry past this point" guard inside the
larger `document_production_activity` function: Temporal attaches a retry policy to an entire
`execute_activity` command, not to a region of code within one activity function, so if
`document_production_activity` as a whole runs under the permissive policy §4.3.1 requires for
`wait_pra`/pause/resume, a worker crash between `run_pra()` returning and the checkpoint write is
retried under that *same* permissive policy regardless of any in-process guard — the guard cannot
stop Temporal's own retry of the whole function from the top. Only a separate `NO_RETRY` activity
for the submission step actually gets Temporal to treat that step as non-retryable. A crash in that
narrow window then fails the workflow cleanly (loud, visible, needing a human/operator to reconcile
or restart the job) rather than silently duplicating a PRA job. Everything *after* a checkpoint
exists — `wait_pra` polling, pause, resume, and the rest of `document_production_activity` — is
safe to retry freely in its own (different) activity invocation, because those steps only ever
consult the checkpoint and never resubmit. The contract fixes the retry-policy asymmetry (a
dedicated `NO_RETRY` submission activity vs. a retryable activity for everything after) and flags
PRA-side idempotency as the complete fix, tracked as an open item alongside the unbounded-
`wait_condition` risk already carried in this
section (below).

**Contract requirement — the activity must actually be retryable (past the submission step), under
a *bounded* policy specifically.** `PlanningWorkflow`'s current
`workflow.execute_activity(document_production_activity, ..., retry_policy=NO_RETRY)`
(`temporal/workflows.py:189-195`) means a worker crash mid-activity fails the whole workflow rather
than letting Temporal re-invoke the activity — unlike the coding team, whose
`workflow.execute_activity(run_pipeline_activity, request, start_to_close_timeout=activity_timeout)`
(`temporal/coding_team_workflow.py:546-551, 574-578`) passes **no** `retry_policy` override at all,
so it runs under the SDK's unbounded default retryable policy. Because this contract makes the
activity idempotent on re-entry — past the submission step above — via the eager checkpoint and
`_check_pending_pause_reentry` (§5), the rest of `document_production_activity` must adopt a
retryable posture too — but **must use `SAFE_RETRY` (`temporal/workflows.py:53-54`) specifically,
not the SDK's unbounded default**, unlike the coding team's activity. This is a deliberate
divergence, not an oversight: every `planning_team` activity, this one included, runs through the
`_guarded` wrapper (`temporal/activities.py:69-118`, thin over
`shared.temporal.activity_helpers.guarded`), whose contract requires `max_attempts` to be an
explicit finite value *matching the phase's own Temporal `RetryPolicy`* (`activities.py:87-88`) —
it uses that number to decide `is_final_attempt` and mark the job FAILED only on the truly last
attempt. An unbounded default policy has no finite `max_attempts` to hand `_guarded`: passing
`RETRYABLE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (or any other finite guess) while Temporal itself retries without limit
would mark the job FAILED after that many attempts even though Temporal keeps trying past it — a
false-terminal failure — while no finite value can correctly represent "unlimited" to `_guarded`
either way. `SAFE_RETRY`'s existing finite `maximum_attempts` (already used, and already correctly
paired with `_guarded`, by every other retryable phase in this same workflow) is required; the
coding team's unbounded-default choice does not transfer here because
`software_engineering_team`'s activities have no equivalent `_guarded`-style finite-attempt-count
contract to violate. Blanket `NO_RETRY` must not remain on `document_production_activity` once the
pause contract lands, but the replacement must be `SAFE_RETRY`, not "no override at all."

**Naming, to keep the two activities and their retry policies straight:** this contract splits what
was one `document_production_activity` into two Temporal activities scheduled separately by
`PlanningWorkflow`: a small `document_production_pra_submit_activity` (illustrative name — #7445-B
picks the actual one) that takes the same `job_id`/`context` the current single activity does
(§5's precondition — it needs `repo_path`/`spec_content` to call `run_pra`) and does only
`run_pra(...)` + the eager checkpoint write, scheduled with `retry_policy=NO_RETRY`; and `document_production_activity` itself, which always starts by loading
the checkpoint (never calling `run_pra` directly), then runs `wait_pra`/pause/resume/finalize under
`SAFE_RETRY` (specifically — not the SDK default; see the `_guarded`-compatibility requirement
below). The workflow calls the submit activity once per job (a no-op
skip if a checkpoint already exists — safe to call again on workflow-level retry, since it just
re-checks the checkpoint) before entering the `document_production_activity` retry/continuation
loop of §4.3.

**Conditional on `use_product_analysis` — none of this pause machinery applies when PRA is
disabled.** `document_production_activity`'s existing `use_product_analysis: bool` parameter
(`temporal/activities.py:289`) already lets a caller opt out of PRA entirely; when `False`,
`run_document_production` never calls `run_pra`/`wait_pra` at all (`phases/document_production.py:147-159`
passes `run_pra=None`, and `DocumentProductionAgent.run`'s `if use_product_analysis and run_pra and
wait_pra:` guard, `agent.py:91`, is simply never true). The workflow must call
`document_production_pra_submit_activity` **only when `use_product_analysis` is `True`** for this
job — calling it unconditionally would submit an external PRA job for a caller that explicitly
opted out. Symmetrically, `document_production_activity`'s own precondition that a checkpoint
already exists (§5) applies only on the `use_product_analysis=True` path; when `False`, there is no
checkpoint to load, no `wait_pra` to resume, and no pause round ever begins — the activity runs
exactly as it does today, unaffected by this contract.

**Postcondition this adds to §5:** `document_production_pra_submit_activity` runs under
`NO_RETRY` and either finds an existing checkpoint (no-op) or performs exactly one `run_pra` call
followed immediately by the checkpoint write; `document_production_activity` never calls `run_pra`
itself, only `load_checkpoint`, and runs under a retry policy that actually permits Temporal to
re-invoke it after a worker crash (not `NO_RETRY`), since retry-then-reentry past the checkpoint is
the mechanism this contract relies on for crash recovery there.

**The pause signal must be caught inside `_guarded`'s `work` callable, never let reach `_guarded`
itself.** Every `planning_team` activity, `document_production_activity` included, runs its actual
work through `_guarded(job_id, phase, ..., work, max_attempts=...)`
(`temporal/activities.py:69-118`), which wraps `work()` in `try: ... except Exception as exc: if
is_final_attempt(max_attempts): fail_job(...); raise` (`shared/temporal/activity_helpers.py:139-146`).
`_ActivityPauseSignal` (§4.4) is itself an `Exception` subclass. If the pause is reached on this
activity's *final* `SAFE_RETRY` attempt (a genuinely reachable state — a couple of earlier attempts
failed transiently, then the next attempt hits a clarification question) and the signal is left to
propagate *out of* `work()` before being caught — e.g., caught only at the outer activity-function
level, around the `_guarded(...)` call itself — `_guarded`'s own `except Exception` intercepts it
first: `is_final_attempt` is true, so it calls `fail_job` (marking the Planning job **FAILED**,
client-visibly terminal) before re-raising. An outer catch would still convert the re-raised signal
into a normal `{"outcome": "paused", ...}` return, so the workflow proceeds as if paused — but the
job record has already been marked FAILED as a side effect, producing a client-visible
contradiction (terminal-FAILED job, workflow still actively running a pause/resume cycle).
**Contract requirement:** the `_ActivityPauseSignal` catch (or PRA's own `answer_callback`
mechanism reaching the same effect) must sit *inside* the callable passed as `work` to `_guarded` —
converting it to the `{"outcome": "paused", ...}` value there, as a normal return, so it never
becomes an `Exception` `_guarded` itself observes. This is a placement requirement on the
implementation, not a behavior change to `_guarded` itself; `_guarded` needs no modification.

**Correction — the exception cannot even survive the polling layer beneath `_guarded`, so it must
never be raised as an exception through this call path at all.** The requirement above (catch
before `_guarded` sees it) implicitly assumed `_ActivityPauseSignal` propagates as a normal Python
exception up through `wait_pra` → `DocumentProductionAgent.run` → `work()`. It does not reach that
far: `wait_pra` is `wait_for_product_analysis_completion`, which drives its poll loop through the
shared `poll_until_terminal` (`shared/http/job_polling.py:395-416`), and that helper's own
`on_poll` invocation (`:409-414`) is wrapped in `try: on_poll(status) except Exception as e: ...
return {status_key: "failed", "error": _ON_POLL_FAILURE}`. `answer_callback` is invoked from
inside `_on_poll` (`adapters/product_analysis.py:92-97`), which is `poll_until_terminal`'s
`on_poll`. So a pause signal raised from `answer_callback` — being an `Exception` — is caught and
swallowed by `poll_until_terminal` itself, logged as an `on_poll` failure, and converted into an
ordinary `{"status": "failed", ...}` terminal result **two layers before** `_guarded` or the
activity function ever gets a chance to see it. `DocumentProductionAgent` would observe what looks
like an ordinary PRA failure and (per its existing, unrelated error handling) return normally; the
workflow would advance past document production having never paused at all — the opposite of this
contract's purpose. **Contract requirement, superseding raise-and-catch for this call path
specifically:** the pause must be signaled as a **return value**, not an exception, starting at the
point closest to where it originates. `wait_for_product_analysis_completion`'s `_on_poll` must,
when a genuine pause (not auto-answering) is needed, communicate that back to
`wait_for_product_analysis_completion`'s own return value without going through
`poll_until_terminal`'s exception path (which swallows it) or its terminal-status path (which
`waiting_for_answers` isn't).

**Keep `poll_until_terminal` itself generic — do not repurpose its `on_poll` return value as a
pause-propagation channel.** An earlier version of this requirement proposed extending
`poll_until_terminal` (`shared/http/job_polling.py:361-416`) so a non-`None` `on_poll` return
stops polling and becomes the helper's own result. That couples a low-level, team-agnostic HTTP
polling utility (used well beyond this one call site) to one team's HITL pause/resume lifecycle,
and introduces a hidden control path: any other caller whose `on_poll` callback ever returns a
non-`None` value (a list, a bool, a progress dict) would silently and unexpectedly stop that
caller's polling too — the helper's current contract (`on_poll: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None]`)
promises no such thing. **Contract requirement instead:** implement the pause detection entirely
within `wait_for_product_analysis_completion` (a Planning-specific wrapper, `adapters/product_analysis.py`)
around its call to `poll_until_terminal`, not inside `poll_until_terminal` itself — e.g., check the
polled status for `waiting_for_answers` *before* invoking `answer_callback`/`poll_until_terminal`'s
`on_poll` at all, and short-circuit `wait_for_product_analysis_completion`'s own return without
needing `poll_until_terminal` to learn anything about pauses; or introduce a distinct,
explicitly-named helper (e.g. `poll_until_terminal_or_pause`) with its own documented pause
contract, leaving `poll_until_terminal` itself untouched for every other caller. Either shape keeps
`shared/http/job_polling.py` generic; this contract does not mandate which.

`_ActivityPauseSignal`-the-exception, and the inside-`_guarded`'s-`work`-callable catch point
above, remain correct for a pause signaled from somewhere *outside* this specific polling call
chain (should one ever exist); through `wait_pra` specifically, the mechanism is return-value
propagation the whole way, not exception unwinding at any point, and it must not be implemented by
widening the shared polling helper's contract.

### 4.3.2 Rollout compatibility for the activity signature change

`document_production_activity` is currently called with three positional args —
`args=[job_id, context, use_product_analysis]` exactly (`temporal/workflows.py:189-197`), matching
every other per-phase activity's positional-args style in this workflow (`:142-215`, e.g.
`intake_activity` at :142-146) — not the single `request`
dict this contract's retry/continuation loop (§4.3) needs in order to carry
`acknowledged_resume_token`. Changing the activity's calling signature is itself a workflow-history
compatibility hazard, independent of the pause feature: a `PlanningWorkflow` execution whose
history was recorded *before* the signature change (i.e., it already scheduled
`document_production_activity` with the old three-positional-arg shape) must replay
deterministically against a worker that has since deployed the new dict-based call — Temporal
requires the *same sequence of commands* on replay, and a changed argument shape for the same
activity name is exactly the kind of non-deterministic edit `workflow.patched` exists to guard.

**Contract requirement:** gate the *entire new command sequence* — not just the argument shape —
behind `workflow.patched(...)`, the same mechanism `PlanningWorkflow` already uses for its own
prior migration (`_PER_PHASE_PATCH`, `temporal/workflows.py:122-140` — "A `PlanningWorkflow`
execution started before the per-phase migration... replays the legacy single-activity path via
the `workflow.patched` gate"). This must cover more than the argument shape: this contract also
*inserts a brand-new command* — the `document_production_pra_submit_activity` call (§4.3.1) —
*before* the existing `document_production_activity` call. Temporal replay requires the exact same
sequence of commands a history originally recorded; a history that scheduled
`planning_document_production` directly (no submit-activity command before it) diverges from a
replay that now schedules a new activity command first, **even if `document_production_activity`
itself is called with its old argument shape** on that branch. So the single new patch marker (e.g.
`_CLARIFICATION_PAUSE_PATCH`) must gate the *whole* new sequence: on `not workflow.patched(...)`,
skip `document_production_pra_submit_activity` entirely and call `document_production_activity`
exactly as today (old args, no resume loop); on the patched branch **and only when
`use_product_analysis` is `True`** (§4.3.1's conditional-submission requirement applies here
unchanged — a patched execution with `use_product_analysis=False` must skip
`document_production_pra_submit_activity` exactly as the legacy branch does, for the same reason:
no checkpoint is expected, and scheduling the submit activity for an explicit opt-out would submit
an external PRA job the caller never asked for), schedule the submit activity first, then run the
new `request`-dict call and retry/continuation loop of §4.3. So there are three sequences, not two:
legacy (old args, no submit activity, no resume loop), patched+PRA-disabled (`request`-dict call,
no submit activity, no resume loop — PRA never engages so nothing to pause on), and
patched+PRA-enabled (submit activity, then `request`-dict call with the full retry/continuation
loop). This exactly mirrors `_PER_PHASE_PATCH`'s own legacy branch, which replays its entire old
single-activity sequence rather than cherry-picking pieces of the new one — reused a second time in
the same workflow, not invented anew.

**`workflow.patched` alone is not sufficient — the activity worker needs its own compatibility
path.** `workflow.patched` only governs what a *workflow* schedules on replay; it says nothing
about the activity *worker* process. During a rolling deploy, an activity task already enqueued
under the old three-positional-arg shape (scheduled by an old-code workflow execution before the
new worker version rolled out) can be picked up by a worker that has already registered the new
dict-only `document_production_activity` implementation — invocation fails before any workflow
code (patched or not) gets a chance to run, and under the activity's current `NO_RETRY` (§4.3.1)
that failure fails the whole workflow. **Contract requirement:** the activity function itself must
accept both call shapes — either a compatibility decoder at the top of
`document_production_activity` that detects the old three-positional-arg invocation and normalizes
it into the same `request` dict the rest of the function expects, or registering the new dict-based
behavior under a distinct `@activity.defn(name=...)` (e.g. `planning_document_production_v2`) while
the old name/signature stays registered and callable until the task queue has drained of old-shape
tasks. `workflow.patched` and this activity-level decoding are both required, addressing two
different compatibility surfaces (workflow replay vs. activity worker invocation) — neither
substitutes for the other.

**Reshaping an existing activity's call is not the only rollout hazard — `document_production_pra_submit_activity`
is a brand-new activity type, and a shape-compatibility decoder cannot help an old worker that has
never registered it at all.** During a rolling deployment, multiple worker replicas at different
code versions serve the same task queue simultaneously; Temporal does not route a given task to a
same-version replica by default. A *new*-code `PlanningWorkflow` execution (patched,
`use_product_analysis=True`) can schedule `document_production_pra_submit_activity`, and that task
can land on an *old* replica that has not yet deployed this contract's code at all — the worker has
no handler registered for that activity name, the task cannot start, and — being `NO_RETRY` — the
activity (and per the backstop above, the workflow, terminally-recorded) fails immediately on a
purely operational rollout race, not a real defect. The three-positional-arg compatibility decoder
above does not help here: there is no old-shaped call for this activity to decode, because it did
not exist before this contract. **Contract requirement:** #7445-B's rollout must use Temporal
Worker Versioning (Build ID-based task queue versioning) so tasks for the new activity route only
to workers that have it registered, or equivalently drain and fully upgrade every worker replica on
this task queue before any workflow begins scheduling `document_production_pra_submit_activity` —
accepting old call shapes in the new worker code (this section's existing requirement) addresses
the reverse direction (old task, new worker) and does not by itself close this one (new task, old
worker).

### 4.4 Explicit hitl.py / pause_cycle.py reuse statement

This design reuses, unmodified in behavior:
- The `_ActivityPauseSignal`-*style* discriminated-pause-payload shape: `{outcome, job_id,
  resume_token, pause_kind, pause_context, pending_questions}`, reused as a value shape only — via
  the `document_production_pra_submit_activity`/`document_production_activity` split (§4.3.1) and
  return-value propagation through `wait_pra`/`poll_until_terminal` all the way to `work`'s return
  (§4.3.1's `poll_until_terminal`-swallows-exceptions correction), **not** the coding team's literal
  exception-raise-and-catch mechanism, which cannot survive `poll_until_terminal`'s own
  `except Exception` on this call path (verified, not assumed — §4.3.1 above). Where the coding
  team unwinds a stack frame via a raised exception, Planning's document-production path unwinds
  via an ordinary return value threaded up through the same call chain — the *destination* shape
  (`{"outcome": "paused", ...}`) is reused verbatim; the *mechanism* that gets there is necessarily
  different, because this call path passes through a shared polling helper the coding team's
  analogous path does not.
- `mint_resume_token`'s exact format and one-mint-per-pause-round rule.
- `_check_pending_pause_reentry`'s three-way classification (no pause / consume / re-emit
  unchanged).
- The job-record pause envelope field names: `waiting_for_answers`, `resume_token`, `pause_kind`,
  `pause_context`, `pending_questions` — Planning's job store (`job_store.py:45-46`) already seeds
  `pending_questions: []` and `waiting_for_answers: False` on every record, so no new fields are
  needed, only new writers.
- The `submit_answers` signal name and payload shape (§4.1).
- The workflow-side wait/buffer state machine (§4.2), copied field-for-field.
- The persist-then-signal answer-submission pattern from
  `coding_team_hitl.submit_pending_answers` (`api/routes/coding_team_hitl.py:20-71`): append
  validated answers to the job record, then signal — never the reverse, never signal-only (§4.3).
- `workflow.patched` for rollout compatibility (§4.3.2) — `PlanningWorkflow`'s own existing
  `_PER_PHASE_PATCH` mechanism, applied a second time rather than inventing a new versioning
  approach.

The only Planning-specific pieces are:
1. **Which activity calls the pause cycle** — `document_production_activity`
   (`temporal/activities.py:285-377`) instead of the coding team's planning/execution activities.
2. **The question source feeding it** — `OpenQuestion` / `resolve_pra_answers`
   (`planning_team/orchestrator.py:45-81`, `planning_team/models.py:216-244`) instead of Tech Lead
   clarify / worker escalation. `OpenQuestion` → `PendingQuestion` conversion is a straightforward
   field mapping (both already share `id`/`question_text`/`context`/`options` shapes); this is
   implementation detail for #7445-B, not a contract decision.
3. **One new `pause_kind` value** (`"planning_clarification"`) rather than reusing one of the
   coding team's three — see §4.1's rationale.
4. **An added external-job checkpoint** (§4.3.1): the coding team's pause has no equivalent,
   because its pause boundary never crosses into a separate external job. Planning's does (PRA), so
   this contract adds `save_checkpoint`/`load_checkpoint` (`shared/temporal/checkpoints.py`) around
   the PRA job id specifically to prevent resubmission on resume. This is a genuine addition to the
   coding-team pattern, not a divergence from it — it uses machinery the platform already documents
   as the sanctioned tool for exactly this ("phase boundaries inside an activity so a retried
   workflow can skip completed phases").
5. **Round-scoped answer persistence** (§4.3): the coding team's Tech-Lead clarify loop is
   effectively single-round per pause; Planning's PRA integration can raise multiple question
   rounds within one activity run, so the persisted `submitted_answers` must be scoped per
   `resume_token` rather than accumulated into one undifferentiated list — otherwise a later
   round's callback can resubmit an earlier round's already-consumed answers.
6. **A retry-policy split, not a blanket correction** (§4.3.1): `document_production_activity`
   currently runs entirely under `NO_RETRY`. This contract splits its PRA-facing work into two
   Temporal activities — a new `document_production_pra_submit_activity` that stays `NO_RETRY`
   (submission has no idempotency key to make it safely retryable) and
   `document_production_activity` itself, which drops `NO_RETRY` in favor of `SAFE_RETRY`
   specifically (not the coding team's unbounded default — `_guarded`'s finite-`max_attempts`
   contract requires a bounded policy, §4.3.1) because it never submits, only
   polls/pauses/resumes against an already-checkpointed job. Planning's current
   blanket `NO_RETRY` is the outlier; a single blanket policy is not the fix, a split one is.

No divergent mechanism is introduced anywhere in this design.

---

## 5. Contract: Preconditions / Postconditions / Invariants

The primitive #7445-B builds must satisfy:

**`document_production_pra_submit_activity` (§4.3.1 — separately scheduled, `NO_RETRY`)**
- *Preconditions:* Called with the Planning `job_id` **and** the post-synthesis `context`
  (specifically `repo_path`, `spec_content`, **and `initial_brief`** — not `repo_path`/`spec_content`
  alone) — the same inputs `document_production_activity` receives today
  (`temporal/activities.py:286-289`). `run_pra` requires `repo_path`/`spec_content`
  (`adapters/product_analysis.py:33-48`), but the content PRA actually gets is **not** the raw
  `spec_content` field — `DocumentProductionAgent.run` derives `spec_to_use = spec_content or
  initial_brief or "# Specification\n\n(To be refined.)"` (`agent.py:70-72`) and calls
  `run_pra(repo_path=repo_path, spec_content=spec_to_use)` (`agent.py:92`) with that *derived*
  value. A brief-only request (`spec_content=None`, `initial_brief` set — a valid
  `PlanningRunRequest` shape) would submit no spec at all if the submit activity used raw
  `spec_content` instead of the same fallback. At the point this activity runs, none of this content
  is durably available anywhere the submit activity could otherwise read it from — it exists only in
  the workflow's in-memory `context` threaded from the synthesis phase (`temporal/workflows.py:176-181`);
  the job record at this point carries `repo_path` but not the synthesized spec or brief
  (`DocumentProductionAgent.run` is what writes `initial_spec.md`, and it hasn't run yet).
  **Contract requirement:** the workflow must pass `context` (or the specific
  `repo_path`/`spec_content`/`initial_brief` fields) into this activity's call, not just `job_id`
  and not `repo_path`/`spec_content` alone. **The `spec_to_use` derivation itself must not be
  reimplemented a second time inside the submit activity** — doing so creates two independently
  maintained copies of `spec_content or initial_brief or "# Specification\n\n(To be refined.)"`
  that must stay byte-for-byte identical (§4.4), and any future change to one (a new fallback
  source, a different default string) silently desyncs from the other, submitting PRA a different
  spec than the resumed `document_production_activity`/`DocumentProductionAgent.run` will later
  validate against. **Contract requirement:** extract the derivation itself into a small shared
  helper (e.g., `planning_team.phases.document_production._derive_spec_to_use(spec_content,
  initial_brief)`, or have the workflow compute the derived value once — in `context` — and pass
  that single already-derived string into both the submit activity and
  `document_production_activity`/`DocumentProductionAgent.run`, rather than each independently
  deriving it from the same raw inputs). Either shape is acceptable; two independent
  re-derivations of the same fallback logic is not. The `"planning_team"`-namespaced job record is
  readable; scheduled by the workflow with `retry_policy=NO_RETRY`.
- *Postconditions:* **Checks the job record's own `status` is still active (`pending`/`running`)
  first, before either checkpoint branch — not merely "readable" as the precondition above states,
  and not only on the checkpoint-absent path.** A checkpoint-present re-invocation is not
  automatically safe to fast-path: an operator reset/restart, or any other re-entry after the
  checkpoint was written, can invoke this activity again for a job that has *since* become cancelled
  or interrupted. If the active-status check only guarded the checkpoint-absent branch, a
  checkpoint-present re-invocation against a now-terminal job would return the ordinary
  checkpoint-bearing success shape (not `skipped_terminal`), and the workflow would proceed into
  `document_production_activity` for a job that should have stopped — silently reintroducing the
  exact class of bug this whole terminal-status-checking requirement exists to prevent, just via the
  other branch. **Contract requirement:** perform the active-status check before branching on
  checkpoint presence at all; on either branch (present or absent), a job whose `status` is not
  `pending`/`running` returns `{"outcome": "skipped_terminal"}` and does nothing else. Only once
  status is confirmed active does the activity check
  `load_checkpoint("planning_team", job_id, "document_production_pra")`: if present, returns
  immediately (no-op — a prior successful run already submitted). A cancellation or
  interruption can land on the job record while this `NO_RETRY` activity is still queued, waiting
  to be dispatched; `_guarded`'s initial progress update does not itself reject a terminal row (per
  its own comment, only intake ever writes `status`, later phases "leave it untouched so they never
  clobber a concurrent cancelled" — `temporal/activities.py:93-96` — which protects against
  *overwriting* a terminal status but says nothing about *skipping work* for a job that already has
  one), and this precondition as originally stated ("the job record is readable") does not exclude
  an already-terminal row either. Without an explicit active-status check, this activity would still
  submit a real external PRA job for a Planning run that can no longer consume its result — a
  needless, non-idempotent side effect against a job nothing will ever resume. **Contract
  requirement:** if the job's own `status` is not `pending`/`running` when this activity runs, treat
  it as a no-op (return without calling `run_pra`, without writing a checkpoint) rather than
  proceeding.

  **Correction — this is a plain read, not a closed race.** An earlier draft of this requirement
  claimed "there is no competing write to race against at this specific check (the job is already
  terminal, not concurrently becoming so)" — that is false: cancellation or interruption can land
  in the window *between* this read and the `run_pra()` POST that follows it, since nothing holds
  the row across that gap the way a conditional `UPDATE` would. This check reduces the window (it
  catches every case where the job was already terminal *before* this activity ran, which is the
  common case) but does not close it completely; a job that becomes terminal in that narrow gap can
  still get a real external PRA job submitted for it. **Contract requirement:** this residual gap is
  an inherited, not-fully-closable risk under this contract's scope (add it to §5's open risks,
  alongside PRA's own lack of submission idempotency) — closing it completely requires coordinating
  submission with a durable active-state claim PRA itself understands (the same class of gap as
  risk 2), which is outside `planning_team`'s boundary; this spec does not claim the plain read
  eliminates the race, only narrows it.

  **This activity must also return a distinct outcome when it skips for terminal status — not
  the same success shape used after a real submission — so the workflow can stop instead of
  proceeding into a checkpoint-requiring phase.** `document_production_activity`'s own precondition
  (below) requires a `document_production_pra` checkpoint to be present before it runs; a terminal
  skip deliberately writes no checkpoint (there is nothing to check for re-entry against). If the
  workflow could not tell "submitted successfully" apart from "skipped, job already terminal" and
  proceeded to `document_production_activity` regardless, that activity's precondition would be
  violated immediately, likely surfacing as its own failure against an already-terminal row —
  potentially re-triggering the same terminal-state-clobbering class of bug the activity-level
  conditional failure writer above exists to prevent, just one activity later. **Contract
  requirement:** this activity must return a distinct `{"outcome": "skipped_terminal"}`-shaped
  result (as opposed to the checkpoint-bearing success shape) when it takes the terminal no-op path,
  and the workflow must branch on that outcome to stop the `document_production` phase entirely
  rather than calling `document_production_activity` next.

  **Correction — "skip to whatever finalize/no-op path is appropriate" is not safe as originally
  worded: `finalize_planning_activity` calls `mark_job_completed` unconditionally.**
  (`temporal/activities.py:443-473`, `mark_job_completed(job_id, summary=summary)` with no status
  guard.) If the workflow reached `finalize_planning_activity` after a `skipped_terminal` outcome —
  exactly what "skip to the finalize path" could be read to mean — it would overwrite a cancelled or
  interrupted job's status with `completed`, the same class of terminal-state-clobbering bug this
  whole line of fixes exists to prevent. **Contract requirement:** on `skipped_terminal`, the
  workflow must `return` immediately — schedule no further activity at all: not
  `document_production_activity`, not `sub_agent_provisioning`, and not `finalize_planning_activity`
  — leaving the job record exactly as whatever terminal state it already reached untouched.
  If absent (checkpoint) and active (status), calls `run_pra(...)`. **`run_pra`/`run_product_analysis`
  returns `None` when the Software Engineering service is unconfigured or the submission POST fails
  (`adapters/product_analysis.py:33-48`) — this activity must treat a `None`/falsy return as a
  failure and raise, not persist a checkpoint with `pra_job_id: None` and return successfully.**
  **Contract requirement — this activity must be wrapped in `_guarded` like every other phase
  activity in this workflow, not raise a bare exception.** `PlanningWorkflow.run` itself has no
  `except` around any `execute_activity` call and never touches the job store on failure — the
  workflow docstring is explicit that "each activity owns its own job-store progress writes and
  marks the job FAILED (then re-raises) on its own error" (`temporal/workflows.py:104-111`), and
  every existing phase activity does so by routing through `_guarded`
  (`temporal/activities.py:69-119`, `mark_job_failed`/`update_job` bound in), which marks the job
  record FAILED on the final attempt before re-raising. If this new activity instead raised a bare
  exception (as "a raised exception here fails this `NO_RETRY` activity... loudly and visibly"
  could be read to imply), Temporal terminates the workflow but the job record is never updated —
  the status endpoint keeps reporting the job as running indefinitely, exactly the silent-hang
  failure mode this activity's own `None`/falsy-return handling above is trying to avoid. This
  activity must call `_guarded(job_id, "document_production_pra", ..., work, max_attempts=1)`
  (`SINGLE_ATTEMPT`, matching its `NO_RETRY` `retry_policy` — the same finite-attempts pairing
  §4.3.2 requires for `document_production_activity`) so a raised exception is both re-raised *and*
  recorded as a job-store `FAILED` before the workflow terminates.

  **`planning_team`'s `_guarded` wrapper hardcodes the same unconditional `mark_job_failed` the
  workflow-level backstop above was corrected away from — this activity needs the conditional
  version too, or the activity's own final-attempt handler clobbers a terminal state before the
  backstop ever runs.** `_guarded` (`temporal/activities.py:69-119`) always binds Planning's
  unconditional `mark_job_failed` (`shared/job_store.py:82-84`) as the failure writer for *every*
  caller; if this activity uses that same wrapper as-is, a cancellation or interruption that lands
  before this activity's own exception is raised gets overwritten with `failed` by `_guarded`
  itself, on its final attempt, *before* the workflow's `except` block and its conditional backstop
  activity (above) ever run — making that backstop's own correction moot for this specific failure
  path, since the damage is already done earlier in the same call stack. **Contract requirement:**
  this activity must not use `planning_team`'s `_guarded` convenience wrapper as-is; it must call
  the underlying `shared.temporal.activity_helpers.guarded` directly (or an equivalent
  activity-local wrapper) with a *conditional* failure writer — the same active-status-guarded
  primitive the workflow-level backstop activity uses — bound in place of the unconditional
  `mark_job_failed`, so this activity's own final-attempt failure handling preserves a terminal
  state exactly as the workflow-level backstop now does, rather than protecting only the
  hard-crash path and leaving the ordinary-exception path still clobbering terminal states.

  **`guarded`'s *progress* writer, not just its failure writer, is also unconditional — and this
  activity's own active-status check (above) runs too late to prevent it.** `guarded`
  (`shared/temporal/activity_helpers.py:100-130`) takes a separate `update_job` callable for its
  *initial* progress write (`current_phase`/`progress`/`status_text`, written before `work` ever
  runs) — conditioning only `mark_job_failed` leaves this first write untouched. Because this
  activity's active-status check happens *inside* `work` (the callable `guarded` invokes only after
  that initial progress write already landed), a queued invocation against an already-cancelled or
  -interrupted job would still mutate that job's progress metadata via `guarded`'s own entry step,
  even though `work` then correctly returns `skipped_terminal` moments later — contradicting the
  "treat it as a no-op" requirement above, which this progress write is not. **Contract
  requirement:** either bind an active-status-guarded `update_job` (not just `mark_job_failed`) into
  this same `guarded` call, or perform the active-status check *before* calling `guarded` at all and
  return `skipped_terminal` directly without entering it — either shape prevents the progress write
  from reaching an already-terminal row, consistent with treating a terminal job as a true no-op
  rather than a no-op only for its main side effect. A raised
  exception here fails
  this `NO_RETRY` activity and the workflow loudly and visibly, which is the correct outcome:
  `document_production_activity`'s precondition requires a checkpoint carrying a *usable*
  `pra_job_id` before it will ever call `wait_pra`, and there is no defined no-PRA fallback for a
  job that requested `use_product_analysis=True` but got no PRA job — that is an operational
  failure to surface, not paper over. Only on a genuine successful `pra_job_id`, immediately persist
  `save_checkpoint("planning_team", job_id, "document_production_pra", {"pra_job_id": ...})` as its
  own atomic write, then return.
- *Invariants:* `run_pra` is called at most once per Planning `job_id`, ever, *when this activity
  itself does not crash between the two steps, and when only one attempt of this activity is ever
  entered concurrently* (a caveat this section corrects and broadens below); a crash in that narrow
  window is one residual risk this spec cannot close without PRA-side idempotency (§5's open risks,
  below) — `NO_RETRY` ensures that crash fails the *workflow* loudly rather than Temporal silently
  retrying into a duplicate submission. A checkpoint is never persisted with a `None`/falsy
  `pra_job_id`.

  **Correction — the checkpoint-first read is a plain read, not a claim, and this activity's
  concurrent-entry hazard is broader than "a crash between `run_pra` and the checkpoint write."**
  Two concurrent entries of this activity — not necessarily from the heartbeat-loss/`SAFE_RETRY`
  scenario this contract's other races share, since this activity is `NO_RETRY`, but equally from an
  operator-triggered reset or an overlapping second workflow execution for the same job — can each
  independently read `load_checkpoint(...)` as absent (nothing has raced ahead of either yet), and
  both then call the non-idempotent `run_pra`, each submitting a real external PRA job, before either
  writes its own checkpoint — with no crash required anywhere in the sequence for this to happen.
  This is a distinct, broader hazard than the already-acknowledged "crash in the narrow window"
  risk, and the checkpoint read alone does not serialize against it. **Contract requirement:** either
  add a durable submission claim/lease this activity acquires *before* calling `run_pra` (understood
  by whatever reset/recovery path can create overlapping entries, so a reset does not simply bypass
  it), or — if no such primitive is added in #7445-B — this concurrent-entry hazard must be stated
  explicitly as a further open risk (§5, alongside the crash-window risk it is distinct from), not
  silently subsumed under the narrower "crash between the two steps" framing this invariant
  originally used. This contract does not itself mandate which; it requires the gap be closed or
  explicitly acknowledged, not left implied-closed by the checkpoint read's existence.

  **Correction — "fails the workflow loudly" is not the same as "the job record reflects
  failure," and a hard worker-process crash defeats `_guarded` entirely, not just this checkpoint
  window.** The `_guarded`-wrapping requirement above marks the job `FAILED` only when the activity
  *raises a Python exception inside `_guarded`'s own `work` callable* — that is, when the process
  is alive to run the `except` handler at all. A worker-process crash (OOM kill, pod eviction,
  segfault) between `run_pra()` returning and the checkpoint write is not a Python exception:
  `_guarded`'s `except` clause never executes, `mark_job_failed` is never called, and once
  Temporal's `NO_RETRY` policy and this activity's timeouts expire, the *workflow* execution fails —
  but `PlanningWorkflow.run` has no `except` around its `execute_activity` calls (confirmed above),
  so nothing updates the job record. The status endpoint keeps reporting the job as running
  indefinitely even though the workflow itself has already terminated — silent from the job
  record's perspective, whatever "loudly" the Temporal Web UI shows. This is not unique to this one
  checkpoint window: it is the same gap for *any* per-phase activity's hard process crash, since
  every phase relies solely on `_guarded` running to completion and none has a workflow-level
  backstop today. **Contract requirement, scoped to what this story adds:** because this activity
  runs under `NO_RETRY`/`SINGLE_ATTEMPT` — zero retry cushion, unlike the `SAFE_RETRY` phases where
  a crash on a non-final attempt still gets a further chance to run `_guarded` to completion — the
  workflow must wrap its `execute_activity(document_production_pra_submit_activity, ...)` call in a
  `try/except` that, on any exception surfacing to the workflow (including one from a crashed,
  never-`_guarded`-completed attempt), performs a best-effort terminal job-store update before
  re-raising to fail the workflow — a workflow-level backstop specifically for the one activity in
  this contract with no retry cushion at all. Extending the same backstop to the pre-existing
  per-phase activities is a legitimate follow-up but out of this story's scope; it does not block
  this contract, since those activities' existing behavior is unmodified by it.

  **Correction — `document_production_activity` is not "pre-existing, unmodified behavior" this
  contract can defer, and it is just as exposed to a hard-crash-on-final-attempt as the zero-cushion
  submit activity is.** The scoping above reasons that only the `NO_RETRY` submit activity needs this
  backstop because `SAFE_RETRY` phases "get a further chance to run `_guarded` to completion" on a
  non-final-attempt crash — but that reasoning only protects a crash on a *non-final* attempt; the
  *final* `SAFE_RETRY` attempt has exactly the same zero-cushion exposure the submit activity has at
  every attempt, since there is no next attempt for Temporal to retry into. `document_production_activity`
  is precisely the activity this contract substantially rewrites — new active-status checks, the
  generation-guarded pause/completion claims, the completion-marker short-circuit, the checkpoint-based
  retry/continuation loop — so treating it as unmodified, deferrable "existing behavior" is no longer
  accurate once this contract ships; a hard crash (OOM, pod eviction, heartbeat timeout) on its own
  final `SAFE_RETRY` attempt defeats `_guarded` exactly as described above, Temporal fails the
  workflow, and the job record is left claiming `pending`/`running` (or a stale pause) indefinitely —
  the same silent-hang failure mode, on the activity this contract most changes. **Contract
  requirement, superseding the scoping-out above:** apply the same workflow-level `try/except`
  backstop to the workflow's `execute_activity(document_production_activity, ...)` call(s) — both the
  initial call and every re-invocation inside the §4.3 retry/continuation loop — invoking the same
  conditional `mark_planning_job_failed_activity` on any exception surfacing to the workflow, exactly
  as required for the submit activity above. Extending this same backstop to the *other*, genuinely
  unmodified per-phase activities (synthesis, intake, etc.) remains a legitimate, out-of-scope
  follow-up; `document_production_activity` itself does not qualify for that deferral.

  **Correction — the `except` block must call a Temporal *activity*, never `mark_job_failed`/
  `update_job` directly from workflow code.** `planning_team/temporal/workflows.py`'s own module
  docstring states "the workflow body is deterministic: it only threads a JSON-native `context`
  dict from one `workflow.execute_activity` call to the next" — `mark_job_failed`/`update_job`
  perform job-service HTTP I/O, which is exactly the kind of nondeterministic external call
  Temporal's workflow sandbox forbids and this codebase's own workflow code never does directly.
  Calling either from the `except` block as literally described above would execute network I/O
  inside the workflow sandbox — at best rejected outright, at worst repeatedly failing the
  workflow task (a Temporal workflow-task failure, not an activity failure) rather than
  terminalizing the job the way this backstop is meant to. **Contract requirement:** register a
  small, separate failure-marking activity (e.g. `mark_planning_job_failed_activity(job_id, error)`,
  itself following this same rollout's worker-versioning requirement above since it too is a new
  activity type) that performs the terminalizing write, and have the workflow's `except` block
  invoke it via `await workflow.execute_activity(...)` — with its own short, bounded retry policy,
  since this call's own failure must not block the workflow from re-raising and terminating — before
  re-raising the original exception.

  **This activity must terminalize *conditionally*, not by calling the existing unconditional
  `mark_job_failed` — and the workflow's own call to it must not let this backstop step's failure
  replace the original error.** Calling `planning_team.shared.job_store.mark_job_failed` as-is would
  write `status: "failed"` unconditionally; if the job was independently cancelled (a user-initiated
  cancel racing the same no-retry submission that is timing out or crashing), this backstop would
  overwrite that `cancelled` status with `failed` — the same class of race
  `update_job_if_not_cancelled` (`db.py:320-366`) already exists to prevent for every other
  terminalizing write in this codebase. **Guarding on `status != 'cancelled'` alone (mirroring
  `update_job_if_not_cancelled` verbatim) is not enough either — `interrupted` is a second terminal
  status this same backstop can just as easily clobber.** `mark_all_active_jobs_interrupted`
  (`job_service/db.py:634-...`, driven by the job service's own shutdown/startup recovery path)
  marks every active job `interrupted` on service shutdown; if that recovery sweep runs while this
  contract's no-retry submission activity is mid-crash or mid-timeout, and a surviving worker later
  executes this backstop activity, an unconditional-except-cancelled guard would overwrite the
  recovery path's `interrupted` status with `failed`, defeating that recovery signal. **Contract
  requirement:** `mark_planning_job_failed_activity` must condition its write on the job still being
  *active* — `status IN ('pending', 'running')`, the same allowlist (and the same real-SQL-column
  correction) as the pause-creation and answer-write primitives above — not merely "not cancelled,"
  so a job that reached *any* other terminal status first (`cancelled`, `interrupted`, `completed`,
  or a prior `failed`) is left exactly as it was. **Contract requirement:** the workflow's
  `except` block must wrap this `execute_activity` call in its own nested `try/except` (or
  `try/finally`) so that if the backstop activity itself exhausts its bounded retries — plausible
  during the very same job-service outage that caused the original failure — that secondary
  exception is caught (logged, not propagated) and the workflow still re-raises the *original*
  submit-activity exception, never lets the backstop's own failure silently replace the real root
  cause the workflow is failing over.

  **A blanket `except` around `execute_activity` also catches workflow *cancellation*, and the
  backstop as described both mishandles it and cannot complete during it.** Two distinct problems,
  both specific to Temporal's cancellation model rather than to ordinary activity failure:
  (1) when the workflow execution is cancelled, the pending `execute_activity` raises
  `CancelledError` — which an unqualified `except Exception`/`except BaseException` catches like any
  other failure, so the backstop marks a *cancelled* job `failed`, misreporting a deliberate
  cancellation as an error (the conditional active-status write narrows this — a job whose row
  already reads `cancelled` is protected — but it does not close it, since the workflow can be
  cancelled while the job row is still `running`, exactly the window the backstop is meant to
  cover); and (2) once the workflow is in a cancelled state, a *newly scheduled*
  `execute_activity` for the backstop is itself immediately cancelled, so the terminalizing write
  never lands at all. **Contract requirement:** the backstop's exception handling must treat
  cancellation as its own case, not fold it into the generic failure path — re-raise
  `CancelledError` (after any cancellation-appropriate bookkeeping) rather than marking the job
  `failed`; and when a terminal job-record write *is* wanted on the cancellation path, that write
  must be issued from a cancellation-shielded scope (`workflow.unsafe.shield()`/the SDK's
  equivalent for the version in use) so it can actually run to completion, since an unshielded
  activity scheduled after cancellation cannot. The ordinary-failure backstop above is unchanged;
  this requirement scopes it so it does not swallow, or silently no-op on, cancellation.

**`document_production_activity` (entry — every invocation, paused or not)**
This contract's pause machinery (checkpoint-before-`run_pra`, the new `SAFE_RETRY` policy, the
retry/continuation loop) applies to **exactly one** of three cases: **patched branch AND
`use_product_analysis=True`**. The other two cases retain today's behavior entirely, unchanged by
this contract:

- *Preconditions (patched branch, `use_product_analysis=True` — the only case this contract's
  pause machinery governs):* Called with a `request` dict optionally carrying
  `acknowledged_resume_token` (§4.3.2's `workflow.patched(_CLARIFICATION_PAUSE_PATCH)` gate);
  `request["use_product_analysis"]` is `True`; the `"planning_team"`-namespaced job record is
  readable; `load_checkpoint(...)` for `"document_production_pra"` already returns a checkpoint
  (the workflow only enters this activity after `document_production_pra_submit_activity` has
  completed — §4.3.1); scheduled by the workflow with `retry_policy=SAFE_RETRY` specifically on
  **every** `workflow.execute_activity(document_production_activity, ...)` call this branch makes
  — the initial call and every re-invocation inside the §4.3 retry/continuation loop alike, since
  each `execute_activity` call is its own independent command and none may silently fall back to
  the SDK's unbounded default, which is incompatible with `_guarded`'s finite-`max_attempts`
  contract (§4.3.1).
- *Postconditions (same case):* Loads the checkpoint and calls `wait_pra(job_id=<checkpointed
  pra_job_id>, ...)` directly. This activity never calls `run_pra` itself in this case.
- *Invariants (same case):* Every entry (fresh call, Temporal retry, or workflow-driven resume)
  reuses the checkpointed `pra_job_id`; retrying this activity can never trigger a second PRA
  submission, because the only code path that submits lives in the other, `NO_RETRY` activity.

  **Contract requirement — this activity must also check the job record's own `status` is still
  active before doing any work, mirroring the submit activity's fix above, not merely inherit a
  "readable row" precondition.** A cancellation or interruption can land in the window between the
  submit activity's own active-status check and this activity actually starting — the submit
  activity's `skipped_terminal` outcome only covers the state at *its* check, not at this activity's
  later, separate dispatch. Without an equivalent check here, this activity would still enter
  `_guarded`, mutate the job's progress metadata via `_guarded`'s unconditional initial write, and
  poll `wait_pra` for up to its external timeout before any later generation-CAS logic ever notices
  the terminal state. **Contract requirement:** perform the same pre-`guarded` active-status check
  (`status IN ('pending', 'running')`) this activity's submit-activity sibling uses, before entering
  `_guarded`/`guarded` at all, and return the same `{"outcome": "skipped_terminal"}` shape when it
  fails — the workflow branches on it identically (return immediately, schedule nothing further).

  **This activity's own final-attempt failure writer needs the same conditional-writer fix as the
  submit activity, not just this new pre-entry check.** The pre-entry check above only covers the
  state at activity start; this activity's work (checkpoint load, `wait_pra` polling, reconciliation)
  can still run for an extended period after that check passes, during which the job can become
  cancelled or interrupted. Because this activity is scheduled with `retry_policy=SAFE_RETRY`
  (§4.3.2), it calls Planning's `_guarded` today, which hardcodes the same unconditional
  `mark_job_failed` the workflow-level backstop and the submit activity were both corrected away
  from — a cancellation or interruption landing mid-work still gets overwritten with `failed` on this
  activity's final `SAFE_RETRY` attempt. **Contract requirement:** this activity must not use
  Planning's `_guarded` convenience wrapper as-is either; like the submit activity, it must call the
  underlying `shared.temporal.activity_helpers.guarded` directly with both a conditional
  active-status-guarded failure writer and a conditional active-status-guarded progress writer bound
  in, exactly as required for `document_production_pra_submit_activity` above — not only the new
  activity this contract introduces, but this pre-existing one too, since this contract is what first
  makes it retryable/pausable and therefore first exposes it to this class of race.

- **Patched branch, `use_product_analysis=False`:** no checkpoint exists or is expected (PRA never
  engages); the activity runs its ordinary non-PRA document-production work, and none of this
  contract's pause machinery (submit activity, pause envelope, retry/continuation loop) applies.

  **"Unaffected" is wrong for this branch, and its retry policy must be stated explicitly.** Two
  things do change here even though the *pause* machinery does not. First, the **call shape**: this
  branch is reached through the patched code path, which passes the `request` dict this contract
  introduces rather than the legacy three positional args — so the activity must decode the new
  shape here too (it is the legacy branch, not this one, that keeps the old positional call).
  Second, and load-bearing: this branch's **`retry_policy` and `_guarded` `max_attempts` were never
  specified**, and the two must agree. `_guarded`'s own precondition requires `max_attempts` to
  match the phase's Temporal `RetryPolicy` (`temporal/activities.py:87-88`); pairing this contract's
  `SAFE_RETRY` with a `_guarded` still passing `SINGLE_ATTEMPT` makes `is_final_attempt` true on the
  *first* transient failure, marking the job FAILED while Temporal goes on retrying — the exact
  false-terminal mode §4.3.1 warns about — while the reverse pairing leaves `_guarded` waiting for a
  final attempt that never comes. **Contract requirement:** this branch keeps today's
  `NO_RETRY`/`SINGLE_ATTEMPT` pairing (`temporal/workflows.py:59-61` documents why document
  production is non-idempotent and must run once: it writes files, and a workflow-level retry must
  not re-run them). It must **not** be switched to `SAFE_RETRY` alongside the PRA-enabled branch:
  the checkpoint protection that makes retry safe there covers the PRA submission specifically, and
  nothing in this branch is checkpoint-protected. The retry-policy split §4.3.1 describes is
  therefore three-way, not two-way — `SAFE_RETRY` for patched+PRA-enabled, `NO_RETRY` for the new
  submit activity, and `NO_RETRY` (unchanged) for both this branch and the legacy branch below.
- **Legacy branch** (`not workflow.patched(...)` — a `PlanningWorkflow` execution whose history
  predates this feature, per §4.3.2): called with the original three positional args, exactly
  `[job_id, context, use_product_analysis]` (`temporal/workflows.py:189-197`'s current shape —
  **not** `[job_id, repo_path, ...]`; the second positional argument is the full context dict, not
  a bare path, and a compatibility decoder that mistakes it for one would lose the specification/PRA
  inputs), never a `request` dict, never with `acknowledged_resume_token` — the legacy branch skips
  `document_production_pra_submit_activity` and the retry/continuation loop entirely (§4.3.2).
  **Retains its exact recorded `retry_policy=NO_RETRY`** — Temporal's replay determinism binds the
  scheduled activity's parameters, retry policy included, to what history recorded; this contract
  must not change it on the legacy branch even though it changes it on the patched branch. Because
  `retry_policy` stays `NO_RETRY` here, `_guarded`'s `max_attempts` for this call must stay
  `SINGLE_ATTEMPT` (matching, per its own precondition — `activities.py:87-88`) — never
  `RETRYABLE_MAX_ATTEMPTS`/`SAFE_RETRY`'s count, which `_guarded` would use to gate `is_final_attempt`
  against a Temporal attempt count that will never actually reach it. When `use_product_analysis`
  is `True` on this branch, `run_pra` is called exactly as it is today (no checkpoint, no submit
  activity) — the legacy branch's PRA behavior is unmodified by this contract, not merely
  compatible with it. The activity implementation must still decode/normalize the legacy
  three-positional-arg call shape into an internal representation before proceeding (§4.3.2's
  activity-level compatibility requirement), but that decoding must not route the legacy branch
  into any of the new checkpoint/pause logic above.

**`document_production_activity` (paused-return path)**
- *Preconditions:* PRA reports unanswered `OpenQuestion`s and no matching persisted pause is being
  resumed (per `_check_pending_pause_reentry`, §4.3).
- *Postconditions:* The activity persists `{waiting_for_answers: True, resume_token, pause_kind:
  "planning_clarification", pause_context: None, pending_questions}` to the job record via a
  **conditional** write — succeed only while no pause is currently active for this job (guard:
  `waiting_for_answers` is falsy/absent on the current row) — separate from, and after, the
  checkpoint write above (no longer required to be combined with it, since checkpoint-presence
  alone already prevents resubmission), then returns (does not raise) `{"outcome": "paused",
  "job_id", "resume_token", "pause_kind", "pause_context", "pending_questions"}` — no further
  job-store read or blocking call past that point. **Contract requirement — this write must not be
  the unconditional `update_job` a first draft of this contract implied.** `SAFE_RETRY` activities
  heartbeat through `BackgroundHeartbeat` (`shared/concurrency/heartbeat.py`), whose own contract
  states "a raising `beat`... never kills the loop: the exception is routed to `on_error` (default:
  swallowed)" — a lost heartbeat (worker pause, GC stall, transient RPC failure) is silently
  absorbed rather than surfaced, so the activity thread keeps running with no signal that Temporal's
  server may have already timed out the attempt and started a new one. Two attempts of the *same*
  activity invocation can therefore both observe "no persisted pause yet," each mint a distinct
  `resume_token` (`mint_resume_token`, unconditioned on anything but its own randomness), and — with
  an unconditional write — both persist successfully, one clobbering the other. Whichever attempt's
  *return value* Temporal actually delivers to the workflow may not be whichever attempt's token
  ended up durably stored last, permanently stranding the pause: the answer-submission route
  accepts only the token in the job record, while the workflow is waiting on the token from the
  attempt result it received. **Contract requirement:** persist the pause envelope with the
  conditional write described above (fails if another attempt already persisted one first); the
  losing attempt must not return its own freshly-minted, never-persisted token as if it won — it
  must reload the job record and re-emit the *winning* attempt's persisted envelope (same
  `resume_token`, `pending_questions`, etc.) as its own return value, so both attempts converge on
  one token regardless of which one Temporal ultimately delivers.

  **The `waiting_for_answers`-falsy guard alone is necessary but not sufficient — it does not fence
  a stale attempt that resurfaces after a *later* attempt has already completed an entire round.**
  Because a lost heartbeat gives no signal the attempt has been superseded (above), a delayed
  attempt can reach this same write arbitrarily later — not just concurrently with the attempt that
  replaced it, but *after* that later attempt has already published a pause, had it answered, and
  cleared the envelope (or the job has finished). At that point `waiting_for_answers` is falsy
  again — legitimately, because the real round already resolved — so the stale attempt's guard
  passes, and it publishes a brand-new pause envelope carrying its own (now-orphaned) token and
  the *original* `pending_questions` it observed long ago. Temporal discards this stale attempt's
  return value once a later attempt has already completed, so the workflow never arms a
  `wait_condition` on this orphaned token — the job record is left claiming `waiting_for_answers:
  True` for a pause nothing will ever resume, silently hanging the job (or, worse, resurrecting an
  already-answered round if a client still holds a stale status response naming it).

  **Contract requirement — fence with a durable, job-scoped `pause_generation` counter, not
  `activity.info().attempt`.** An earlier draft of this requirement proposed fencing on Temporal's
  own per-invocation attempt counter; that is wrong, because `activity.info().attempt` resets to 1
  on *every new activity invocation* — and each pass through the §4.3 retry/continuation loop
  (paused → signaled → re-invoked) is a fresh `workflow.execute_activity` call, hence a fresh
  invocation whose attempt counter restarts. A strict-greater-than-recorded-attempt guard would
  therefore reject the second, legitimate PRA question round outright (its first attempt is itself
  attempt 1, not greater than whatever attempt number round one recorded), and separate activity
  invocations can independently reuse the same attempt number regardless. The correct fence is a
  small integer field on the job record itself — `pause_generation`, starting at `0`, durable across
  every invocation of this job — read by the activity *before* it calls PRA (call this
  `observed_generation`), and used as an optimistic-concurrency version check in the same atomic
  write: **succeed only if `waiting_for_answers` is currently falsy AND the job record's current
  `pause_generation` still equals `observed_generation`** (nothing else progressed this job's pause
  state since this attempt last read it), and on success set `pause_generation =
  observed_generation + 1` together with the rest of the pause envelope. A stale attempt whose
  `observed_generation` a later attempt has since advanced past fails this guard unconditionally,
  regardless of what `waiting_for_answers` happens to read at that moment.

  **The `pause_generation` fence alone still admits one more stale-resurrection shape: a job that
  reached a *terminal* status without ever locally advancing `pause_generation` at all.** A delayed
  attempt that observed unanswered PRA questions at generation 0 is not guaranteed to be racing
  against another *local* pause — PRA can also be answered directly through its own public
  answers endpoint (bypassing this Planning workflow's signal path entirely, since PRA is an
  independent SE-team service reachable outside Planning), or a newer attempt's `wait_pra` call can
  simply observe `"completed"` with no further questions and finish the job without ever calling
  the paused-return path. In either case `waiting_for_answers` stays falsy and `pause_generation`
  stays at `0` throughout — nothing *local* ever advanced — so the delayed attempt's guard above
  passes cleanly and it publishes an orphan pause onto a job that has already terminally completed
  (or failed). **Contract requirement:** the same conditional write must additionally guard on the
  job record's own top-level `status` still being active — i.e. not `JOB_STATUS_COMPLETED` or
  `JOB_STATUS_FAILED` (`planning_team/shared/job_store.py`'s existing status constants) — so a
  write against a job that has already reached a terminal status fails this guard unconditionally,
  independent of whatever `pause_generation`/`waiting_for_answers` happen to read. Terminalizing a
  job (the existing `finalize_planning_activity` completion path, or this contract's own
  crash-backstop failure path below) is itself then the thing that permanently invalidates every
  outstanding `observed_generation` for that job, without needing to touch `pause_generation` at
  all.

  **This requires a new job-store primitive — it cannot be expressed with `update_job_if_not_cancelled`
  or the `resume_token`-guarded primitive from §4.4, and implementing it as a client-side
  read-then-write reintroduces the exact TOCTOU race this section exists to close.**
  **Contract requirement:** #7445-B MUST add a second narrowly-scoped conditional-write primitive —
  e.g. `create_pause_if_generation_matches(job_id, observed_generation, **pause_fields)` —
  mirroring `update_job_if_not_cancelled`'s single server-side `UPDATE ... WHERE` shape and
  `True`/`False`/`None` return convention. **The `status` predicate must read the SQL `jobs.status`
  column directly (`status IN ('pending', 'running')`), exactly as `update_job_if_not_cancelled`
  itself guards on `status != 'cancelled'` — never `data->>'status'`.** `status` is a top-level SQL
  column, not a JSONB field: `_prepare_update_fields`/`_execute_status_update`
  (`backend/job_service/db.py:222-255,258-300`) pop `status` out of `fields` before it ever reaches
  the `data` JSONB payload and persist it to its own `jobs.status` column instead — `data->>'status'`
  on this schema is always `NULL`, and `NULL NOT IN (...)`/`NULL IN (...)` evaluate to `NULL`
  (neither true nor false) in SQL, so a `WHERE` guarded that way would never match any row and this
  primitive would never create a pause at all. An active-state allowlist (`status IN
  ('pending', 'running')`, matching this same file's own status vocabulary) is also the safer form
  here — it excludes `cancelled`/`interrupted` as well as `completed`/`failed`, so a cancelled or
  interrupted job cannot be resurrected by a late pause-creation write either, not just a completed
  or failed one. The rest of the guard stays JSONB-scoped, since `waiting_for_answers`,
  `pause_generation`, `resume_token`, and `pending_questions` are ordinary team-specific fields
  inside `data`: `status IN ('pending', 'running') AND (data->>'waiting_for_answers' IS NULL OR
  data->>'waiting_for_answers' = 'false') AND COALESCE((data->>'pause_generation')::int, 0) =
  %(observed_generation)s`, with the write setting `pause_generation = observed_generation + 1`
  alongside `waiting_for_answers`/`resume_token`/`pause_kind`/`pause_context`/`pending_questions`.
  This is a third instance of the same proven conditional-`UPDATE` pattern established by
  `update_job_if_not_cancelled` and extended by `update_job_if_resume_token_matches` (§4.4) — not a
  generic optimistic-locking framework to design from scratch.

  A losing (stale-fenced) attempt follows the same reload-and-re-emit rule above, but reloads
  whatever the job record's *current* state actually is (paused on a newer round, or already
  completed) rather than assuming its own now-invalid pending-questions snapshot is still current.

  **A third, undefined reload outcome exists between those two: active, no pause envelope, and no
  completion marker yet — a round genuinely still in flight.** The resume path's step (2) clears the
  *previous* round's pause envelope (`waiting_for_answers: False`) as soon as PRA confirms the
  answer applied, but that clearing attempt may still be mid-flight on `wait_pra`'s next poll (to
  learn whether PRA has a further round or is done) when a stale, fenced-out attempt reloads —
  finding the job `running`, `waiting_for_answers` falsy, and no pause envelope *and* no completion
  marker, because the winning attempt genuinely hasn't reached either outcome yet. Because the
  surviving (non-discarded) Temporal attempt can be the one that lost this generation CAS, leaving
  this intermediate state unhandled risks the only attempt Temporal will actually accept for this
  invocation having nothing well-defined to return — erroring, or replaying stale work, rather than
  advancing the workflow. **Contract requirement:** a losing attempt that reloads into this
  intermediate state (active, no pause, no completion marker) must not error or fabricate a result —
  it must retry the reload after a short bounded wait (the winning attempt is, by construction,
  still actively working toward one of the two defined outcomes and will reach one), or equivalently
  treat this as "not yet resolved, poll again" rather than a terminal branch of its own. This is a
  transient state by construction, not a fourth durable outcome this contract needs to define new
  persisted fields for.

  **"Retry until the winner publishes" assumes the winner survives to publish — it might not.** The
  attempt that won the clear (and is now polling `wait_pra` toward one of the two defined outcomes)
  can itself crash or be cancelled before reaching either one, leaving the intermediate state
  permanently unresolved — no amount of bounded-wait retrying by a losing attempt reaches a defined
  outcome, because there is no longer anyone working toward one. Because this activity's retries are
  finite (`SAFE_RETRY`, not unbounded), a losing attempt that keeps retrying this reload indefinitely
  eventually exhausts its own attempt budget and fails a job that is, in fact, still recoverable —
  nothing is structurally broken, the prior owner simply died mid-work. **Contract requirement:** a
  losing attempt reloading into the intermediate state must retry only a small bounded number of
  times (or for a short bounded wall-clock budget) before treating the winner as presumed dead and
  taking over the work itself — re-entering the same `wait_pra` polling this reconciliation was
  waiting on, which is safe to do redundantly since `wait_pra` is itself an idempotent read against
  PRA's own job status, not a new submission. This does not require a new durable lease/ownership
  primitive: the takeover attempt simply resumes the same poll-and-decide logic any attempt would
  perform, and if the presumed-dead winner turns out to still be alive and completes first, the
  takeover attempt's own next reload will find one of the two defined durable outcomes and converge
  normally.

  **A fourth, genuinely durable reload outcome is still undefined: the job itself became terminal
  (cancelled, interrupted, or independently failed) while this claim was in flight.** The
  conditional claim's guard includes `status IN ('pending', 'running')`; if a cancellation or
  interruption lands first, the guard fails for that reason alone, with no pause envelope and no
  completion marker ever written — a case the "intermediate, retry" handling above explicitly does
  not cover (that branch applies "only while active"; a terminal row is not active). A losing
  attempt that reloads into a genuinely terminal row has nothing to reload-and-re-emit: it is not
  paused, not completed, and not merely "not yet resolved." If this activity instead raises for lack
  of any defined branch, it is retryable (`SAFE_RETRY`) and can eventually reach its own `_guarded`
  final-attempt failure writer — unconditional, per the earlier finding this activity's failure
  writer must guard against, unless that same conditional-writer fix is applied here too — clobbering
  the terminal status the workflow was trying to respect in the first place. **Contract
  requirement:** a losing attempt that reloads and finds the job's own `status` no longer
  `pending`/`running` must return a distinct terminal/skipped outcome (the same
  `{"outcome": "skipped_terminal"}` shape §4.3.1 already establishes for the submit activity, reused
  here rather than inventing a second shape) instead of raising or fabricating a paused/completed
  result, and the workflow must branch on it the same way — return immediately, scheduling no
  further activity — exactly as it does for the submit activity's own terminal skip.

  **The terminal-status guard alone leaves one more race: a stale attempt's pause-creation write can
  still land in the narrow window *before* the job's status actually flips to terminal.** Two
  overlapping attempts (the same heartbeat-loss scenario throughout this section) can each be
  mid-flight when `wait_pra` reports `"completed"` (no more questions): one attempt takes that
  success path and is about to return; the other, stale attempt is still executing the paused-return
  path and can successfully pass the `pause_generation`/status guard an instant *before*
  `finalize_planning_activity`'s status write actually lands — the job record is still `running` at
  that exact moment, so the terminal-status predicate above does not yet block it. Temporal then
  accepts whichever attempt's *result* the workflow was actually awaiting (ordinarily the successful
  completion), the workflow proceeds to finalize, and the orphan pause envelope the stale attempt
  just wrote is never cleared by anything — the same silent-hang outcome this whole fencing scheme
  exists to prevent, just relocated to a narrower timing window instead of eliminated. **Contract
  requirement:** the success path (`wait_pra` reporting `"completed"`, no pause) must *also* advance
  `pause_generation` as part of its own terminal job-record write — the same field, the same
  optimistic-concurrency mechanism already established above, not a new one — so that "claim
  completion" and "create a pause" become mutually exclusive on the *same* guarded field regardless
  of their exact ordering relative to the separate `status` column flip.

  **Advancing `pause_generation` unconditionally on the success path is not enough — that write
  must itself go through the same conditional guard, or it can silently clobber a pause that already
  won.** If the success path's write is an ordinary unconditional `update_job` that merely *sets*
  `pause_generation` to a new value, it does not check whether a stale attempt's pause-creation
  write already won the race and advanced `pause_generation` (and `waiting_for_answers`) first — an
  unconditional write from the success path can still proceed, overwrite `pause_generation` again,
  and let the workflow continue to finalize believing the job completed, while the *other* attempt's
  now-orphaned pause envelope (`waiting_for_answers: True` and its `resume_token`) is left behind
  untouched, unreachable, and never cleared. **Contract requirement:** the success path's
  terminal write must use the *same* `create_pause_if_generation_matches`-style conditional
  `UPDATE` — guarded on `status IN ('pending', 'running') AND waiting_for_answers` falsy `AND
  pause_generation == observed_generation` — to *claim* completion, not merely to record it.

  **Claiming completion at the point `wait_pra` reports `"completed"` is too early — that point
  precedes handoff assembly and persistence entirely.** `wait_pra` returning `"completed"` happens
  deep inside `run_document_production` (`temporal/activities.py:326-334`); the activity then still
  builds `merged = _merge_context(...)`, assembles/patches `handoff`, and persists it via
  `update_job(job_id, handoff_package=handoff, ...)` (`temporal/activities.py:335-365`) — all of
  which happens *after* `wait_pra` already returned. If the completion claim above is made as soon as
  `wait_pra` reports completion and the activity then crashes before that later `update_job` call, a
  retried/losing attempt that reloads and finds the completion marker already set re-emits success
  per the rule below — but the handoff was never persisted, and the workflow proceeds to finalize a
  job with no `handoff_package`.

  **Sequencing the completion claim strictly after a separate handoff-persisting write is not
  sufficient either — it only narrows the crash window this section exists to close, it does not
  close it.** Two durable writes, however ordered, still leave a gap between them: if the handoff
  write lands but a competing pause-creation attempt's conditional write (the paused-return path
  above) wins the `pause_generation` race in the interval before the completion claim itself is
  issued, this attempt's completion claim then fails its own guard — but the handoff and
  `open_questions`/`resolved_questions` fields it already persisted are now sitting on a job record
  that is correctly about to report *paused*, not completed. A losing completion attempt in that
  state must re-emit the pause result per the rule below, yet terminal-shaped output it already wrote
  contradicts that re-emitted outcome — the job record simultaneously carries a fresh handoff meant
  for a completed run and an active pause envelope for a round that hasn't been answered.
  **Contract requirement:** the handoff/`open_questions`/`resolved_questions` output fields and the
  completion marker (and `pause_generation` advance) must be committed by the *same* conditional
  `UPDATE` — one atomic, generation-guarded write that both claims completion and persists the
  output — not two separable durable writes in any order. If that single write's guard fails (a
  competing pause already won), none of the output fields are persisted either; the losing attempt
  reloads and re-emits whatever the winner actually recorded, exactly as the rule below already
  requires, with no partially-committed output left behind either way.

  **The completion claim leaves the job's SQL `status` column untouched — still `pending`/`running`
  — and `finalize_planning_activity` still terminalizes it unconditionally afterward.**
  `finalize_planning_activity` calls `mark_job_completed(job_id, summary=summary)` with no status
  guard (`temporal/activities.py:472-473`; the underlying `mark_job_completed`,
  `shared/job_store.py:75-79`, unconditionally writes `status=JOB_STATUS_COMPLETED`). If a
  cancellation, or the job-service shutdown/recovery sweep (`mark_all_active_jobs_interrupted`),
  marks the job `cancelled`/`interrupted` after this activity's completion claim wins but before the
  workflow reaches `finalize_planning_activity`, that later, unconditional write overwrites the
  terminal `cancelled`/`interrupted` status with `completed` — the same class of terminal-state-
  clobbering race this contract has already closed for the pause-creation write, the workflow-level
  backstop, and the submit/document-production activities' own failure writers, left open here
  because `finalize_planning_activity` itself predates this contract and was never in scope for those
  earlier fixes. **Contract requirement:** #7445-B must make `finalize_planning_activity`'s
  terminalizing write conditional too — guarded on the same active-status allowlist (`status IN
  ('pending', 'running')`) as every other terminalizing write in this contract — so a job that reached
  `cancelled`/`interrupted` between this activity's completion claim and finalize is left exactly as
  it was, rather than resurrected as `completed`. This is a pre-existing activity whose exposure this
  contract widens (by introducing the first workflow path where a pause/resume round can race against
  external cancellation before finalize runs), not a new activity — but the fix belongs in this
  contract's scope because this contract is what first makes the race reachable.

  **Making the write conditional is not sufficient by itself — `_work()` must also branch on whether
  it won, not silently continue as if it always does.** `finalize_planning_activity`'s existing
  `_work()` (`temporal/activities.py:472-494`) calls the terminalizing write, then unconditionally
  proceeds into the audit block (`get_job`/`record_planning_run`) and returns `{"success": True,
  ...}` regardless of what the write reported. A conditional write that merely returns `False` on a
  guard failure, with the caller ignoring that return value, changes nothing observable: the audit
  block still runs and calls `record_planning_run` — persisting a `planning_runs` row that
  attributes a completed-planning outcome to a job that is actually `cancelled`/`interrupted` — and
  the activity still returns success, so the workflow still believes finalize succeeded. **Contract
  requirement:** the conditional terminalizing write must report whether it won (the same
  `True`/`False`/`None` convention as this contract's other conditional primitives), and `_work()`
  must check that result: on a loss, skip the audit block entirely (there is nothing to audit — the
  job never completed) and return a result reflecting that this attempt did not complete the job,
  rather than the unconditional `{"success": True, ...}` shape. The workflow does not need a new
  branch for this — `finalize_planning_activity` is the terminal activity in the workflow's own
  sequential chain (§4.3), so a non-completing return here simply means nothing further schedules,
  matching the treatment of every other `skipped_terminal`-shaped stop in this contract.

  **Making only `mark_job_completed` conditional leaves `finalize_planning_activity`'s own `_guarded`
  wrapper untouched, and that wrapper writes unconditionally on both its entry and its failure
  path.** `finalize_planning_activity` is wrapped in Planning's `_guarded`
  (`temporal/activities.py:499-506`) exactly like `document_production_activity` was before its own
  fix above (§4.3.1) — the same wrapper that (a) performs an unconditional initial
  `current_phase`/`progress`/`status_text` write *before* `_work()` (and its now-conditional
  completion check) ever runs, and (b) hardcodes the unconditional `mark_job_failed` as its
  final-`SAFE_RETRY`-attempt failure writer if anything inside `_work()` raises. If a cancellation or
  interruption lands *before* `finalize_planning_activity` even starts — not only in the narrower
  window between the completion claim and finalize already covered above — this wrapper's own entry
  write still mutates the terminal row's progress metadata, and any transient failure inside `_work()`
  (the `get_job` re-read, an audit-block exception the `except Exception` doesn't happen to catch,
  though that block already isolates most of its own errors) can still let `_guarded`'s own
  final-attempt handler overwrite the terminal status with `failed`, exactly the class of race this
  contract has already corrected for `document_production_pra_submit_activity` and
  `document_production_activity` (§4.3.1). Conditioning `mark_job_completed` alone does nothing about
  either of `_guarded`'s own writes, which run outside and around it. **Contract requirement:** apply
  the same fix already required of `document_production_activity` here too — call the underlying
  `guarded` directly (in place of Planning's `_guarded` convenience wrapper) with a conditional
  active-status-guarded failure writer bound in, mandatorily, exactly as required for both
  document-production activities above; the progress writer alone may instead be covered by
  performing the active-status check *before* entering `guarded` and returning a no-op result
  directly for an already-terminal job (the "either/or" this contract allows, per the submit
  activity's own §4.3.1 treatment).

  **Correction — the failure writer is not part of that "either/or"; a pre-entry check alone does not
  protect it.** The pre-entry-check alternative above only prevents the *progress* write from
  reaching an already-terminal row — it covers the job's status at the single instant the check runs,
  before `guarded`/`_work()` ever starts. It says nothing about a cancellation or interruption that
  lands *after* that check passes but *while* `_work()` is running (the `get_job` re-read, the audit
  block) and `_work()` then raises on the final `SAFE_RETRY` attempt: `guarded`'s own final-attempt
  handler still runs, and if it is bound to the unconditional `mark_job_failed` rather than the
  conditional writer, it still overwrites whatever terminal status landed in that window with
  `failed` — the pre-entry check did nothing to prevent this, because the race it closes (status at
  entry) is different from the race the failure writer closes (status at final-attempt failure,
  which can be arbitrarily later). **Contract requirement, clarifying the choice above:** the
  conditional active-status-guarded failure writer is mandatory in every implementation of this fix,
  not an alternative to anything; the pre-entry-check-instead-of-conditional-writer choice applies
  only to the progress writer, exactly as it already does for the submit activity's own §4.3.1
  treatment — this finalize fix must not be read as offering that same either/or for the failure
  writer too.

  **A failed claim does not by itself prove "a pause won" — it could just as easily mean a different
  overlapping attempt's own *completion* claim won first.** Two attempts can both reach `wait_pra`
  reporting `"completed"` (the same heartbeat-loss overlap as every other race in this section); one
  succeeds at this same conditional claim (advancing `pause_generation`, but its Temporal *result*
  is the one that gets discarded, since Temporal only delivers the surviving attempt's result to the
  workflow), the surviving attempt then attempts the identical claim and loses — but the job record
  at that point is not paused at all: it is still `running`, `waiting_for_answers` is falsy, and
  `finalize_planning_activity` simply hasn't run yet. A losing attempt that assumes a failed claim
  always means "reload and return the paused result" has no paused result to return in this case,
  and cannot resolve to anything — leaving no attempt able to advance the workflow at all.
  **Contract requirement:** the conditional completion claim must persist a small, durable
  completion marker (e.g. `document_production_outcome: "completed"`, or equivalently reusing
  `pause_generation`'s parity/a dedicated field) as part of the *same* atomic write that advances
  `pause_generation`, not merely the counter. A losing attempt must reload the job record and branch
  on what it actually finds: a populated pause envelope (`waiting_for_answers: True`) means re-emit
  the *paused* result exactly as a losing paused-return attempt does; a completion marker instead
  means re-emit the *same successful completion* result the winning attempt would have returned
  (not raise, not treat the lost claim as an error) — the two code paths converge on "reload and
  re-emit whatever the winner actually recorded," never on an assumption about which side won.

  **The marker check above is described only for an attempt that loses its *own* conditional claim
  — it does nothing for a brand-new activity re-entry that never attempts a claim at all, because the
  marker from a prior successful (but never-returned) attempt already exists before this entry even
  starts.** If a previous attempt's atomic claim-and-persist write succeeds but that attempt's
  process then crashes before its result reaches Temporal, the *next* `SAFE_RETRY` re-entry of this
  activity starts from scratch: the job's `status` is still `pending`/`running` (only
  `finalize_planning_activity`, later, sets the terminal status — the completion claim itself does
  not, per the correction above), the checkpoint is present, and nothing in this activity's described
  flow checks the completion marker *before* re-running `wait_pra` and re-attempting document
  production. This fresh attempt reads the *current* (already-advanced) `pause_generation` as its own
  `observed_generation`, so its own eventual completion claim would not be "losing" in the sense the
  correction above describes — there is no concurrent winner to lose to, this attempt simply doesn't
  know a marker already exists until it gets there on its own. In the meantime it has redundantly
  redone `wait_pra` polling and full document-production output assembly for a job that already
  completed successfully; if any part of that redundant work hits a transient failure, this
  attempt's own final-`SAFE_RETRY`-attempt failure writer (now correctly conditional per the earlier
  fix) can still terminalize the job as `failed` while it is genuinely still active — a job whose
  output was already durably persisted and completion already durably claimed gets marked failed by
  redundant work that never needed to run. **Contract requirement:** every entry into this activity
  — not only a losing conditional-claim attempt — must check for the durable completion marker
  *first*, before doing any checkpoint-based `wait_pra` polling or document-production work at all.
  If the marker is already present, reconstruct and return the same slim successful result
  immediately (no re-poll, no re-assembly, no new claim attempt) — the same "reload and re-emit
  whatever the winner actually recorded" rule above, applied as the activity's very first check
  rather than only as a losing-claim fallback.

  **Making the completion-marker check the activity's very first check, unconditionally, reopens the
  exact terminal-state-clobbering problem the `skipped_terminal` requirement above exists to close.**
  If the atomic output/marker write succeeds and the process then crashes before returning, and the
  job is *subsequently* cancelled or interrupted before the next `SAFE_RETRY` re-entry runs, an
  entry-order that checks the marker before checking active status finds the marker, reconstructs the
  cached success result, and returns it — without ever observing that the job is no longer
  `pending`/`running`. The workflow, seeing an ordinary successful return rather than
  `skipped_terminal`, proceeds to schedule downstream work (`sub_agent_provisioning`,
  `finalize_planning_activity`) for a job that should have stopped — silently resurrecting exactly
  the class of bug the terminal-status check earlier in this section was written to prevent, just
  triggered through the marker path instead of the ordinary-work path. **Contract requirement,
  ordering the two checks:** check the job's active status *first* — before the completion-marker
  check, and before any checkpoint-based `wait_pra`/document-production work — and return
  `skipped_terminal` immediately for a job that is not `pending`/`running`, exactly as required
  elsewhere in this section; only once status is confirmed active does the marker check run, ahead of
  any re-poll or re-assembly work, per the requirement above. The marker check stays ahead of the
  PRA/document-production work; the status check stays ahead of the marker check.

  **The status check and the cached-marker return are still two separate operations within one
  activity invocation — a cancellation landing between them produces a truthful-when-checked but
  stale-by-return success, and nothing downstream re-verifies before acting on it.** Ordering the two
  checks (above) closes the window where status is *already* terminal when this activity starts; it
  does not, and cannot, close the narrower window where the job becomes terminal *after* this
  activity's own status check passes but *before* the workflow receives and acts on its return value —
  the same class of irreducible gap this contract has already acknowledged elsewhere (§5's open risks)
  wherever a check and a later action are not one atomic operation. Concretely: the workflow, seeing
  this activity's ordinary (non-`skipped_terminal`) successful return, proceeds to schedule
  `sub_agent_provisioning_activity` next — an activity this contract does not otherwise modify, still
  wrapped in Planning's unconditional `_guarded` (`temporal/activities.py:432-438`), whose own entry
  write mutates progress unconditionally and whose failure path can still overwrite a cancellation
  that landed in this gap with `failed`. Checking only at `document_production_activity`'s own entry
  does not protect this specific downstream window. **Contract requirement:** apply the same
  pre-`guarded` active-status check and `skipped_terminal`-equivalent short-circuit already required
  of `document_production_activity` and `finalize_planning_activity` to
  `sub_agent_provisioning_activity` as well — not because this contract otherwise touches that
  activity's own logic, but because this contract is what introduces the specific
  check-then-later-act gap immediately upstream of it (the completion-marker short-circuit above);
  narrowing the window at this next activity's own entry is the achievable mitigation, the same way
  finalize's own entry check narrows the window ahead of it. This does not claim to close the
  underlying gap completely — no single per-activity check can, since the same race recurs at every
  activity boundary in the chain — only to apply this contract's own established mitigation
  consistently at the boundary it newly creates.

  **The pre-entry check just required for `sub_agent_provisioning_activity` protects only its
  progress write, not its failure writer — the same distinction already corrected for
  `finalize_planning_activity` applies here too.** `sub_agent_provisioning_activity` is
  `SINGLE_ATTEMPT`/`NO_RETRY` (`temporal/activities.py:437-438`), so if a cancellation or interruption
  lands *after* the new pre-entry check passes but *while* the activity is doing its own work (the
  AI-Systems build poll, the handoff read-modify-write) and the activity then fails on that one
  attempt, Planning's `_guarded` wrapper still runs its unconditional `mark_job_failed` — the pre-entry
  check did nothing to prevent this, exactly as established for finalize above (a pre-entry check
  covers status *at entry*, not status *at failure*, which can be arbitrarily later within the same
  invocation). **Contract requirement:** apply the same mandatory conditional active-status-guarded
  failure writer already required for `document_production_activity` and `finalize_planning_activity`
  to `sub_agent_provisioning_activity` as well — the pre-entry check alone is sufficient only for the
  initial progress write, never a substitute for the conditional failure writer, consistent with every
  other activity this contract corrects.
- *Invariants:* The activity never blocks waiting for a human answer. It is safe to call multiple
  times for the same `job_id`/pause round: a call that finds a persisted pause whose token does not
  match `acknowledged_resume_token` re-emits the same paused payload unchanged, performing no new
  PRA work and no duplicate persistence. Exactly one pause envelope is ever durably active for a
  given job at a time, even when multiple concurrent attempts of the same activity invocation reach
  the paused-return path simultaneously.

**`document_production_activity` (resume path)**
- *Preconditions:* `request["acknowledged_resume_token"]` equals the job record's persisted
  `resume_token`; the job record's answer store (persisted by the answer-submission path *before*
  it signaled — §4.3) carries a batch tagged with that same `resume_token` covering every
  **required** question in `pending_questions` (matching `validate_answers`'s own
  `required_ids - answered_ids` check, §4.1 — optional questions may legitimately be omitted, and
  PRA's `apply_answers` supplies its own defaults for those; treating full coverage as a
  precondition would make an already-validated, already-accepted submission impossible to resume);
  a PRA-job-id checkpoint for this job is present (§4.3.1).
- *Postconditions, in this order (§4.3's ordering requirement below):* (1) the answer batch tagged
  with the resumed `resume_token` — never the full accumulated answer history, never the signal
  payload directly — is submitted to PRA via `submit_product_analysis_answers`/`answer_callback`;
  (2) only once that submission is confirmed applied does the activity atomically clear the pause
  envelope (`waiting_for_answers`, `resume_token`, `pause_kind`, `pause_context`,
  `pending_questions`) *and* mark that batch consumed (or move it into `resolved_questions`) in one
  job-record update; (3) `wait_pra` resumes polling against the checkpointed external PRA job id —
  `run_pra` is not called again; the activity proceeds to its normal terminal return shape (or
  pauses again, for the next round, per the paused-return path above).

  **Contract requirement — step (1)'s submission must not be gated by a truthiness check on the
  answer batch.** `wait_for_product_analysis_completion`'s existing `_on_poll` callback only calls
  `submit_product_analysis_answers` `if answers` (`adapters/product_analysis.py:92-97`) — a
  truthiness gate on the batch, not on whether a submission is owed. An implementation that reuses
  that callback path for step (1) makes "did we POST the resumed round's answers" depend on the
  batch being non-empty rather than on the resume path having a round to answer. **Contract
  requirement:** step (1) must POST whatever batch the resumed round actually carries, driven by
  "this resume round owes PRA a submission," never by `if answers` — bypassing or not reusing that
  truthiness-gated callback path.

  **This requirement is about the *gate*, not about sending empty batches — an empty batch is
  unreachable for a PRA-sourced round and must not be POSTed if one somehow appears.** An earlier
  draft justified this rule with an "all-optional round produces a valid empty batch" scenario;
  §4.1 establishes that premise is false — `convert_to_pending_questions` stamps `"required": True`
  on every question, so `required_ids == pending_ids` and a complete batch always covers the whole
  round. Worse, POSTing an empty batch would be actively harmful: PRA's answers route rejects any
  batch missing a required id with a 400 (`api/routes/product_analysis.py:266-271`), `_on_poll`
  never inspects the response, and `wait_for_product_analysis_completion` has no failure branch —
  so the "valid, expected empty POST" that draft mandated degrades to a silent hang until
  `MAX_POLL_WAIT` (3600s), exactly the failure mode this contract flags for every other rejected
  resubmission. **Contract requirement, superseding "including an empty one" above:** an empty
  batch at step (1) is a contract violation to surface (raise, so `SAFE_RETRY`/the failure path
  handles it visibly), not a POST to send — the resume path's own preconditions guarantee a
  non-empty batch for every PRA-sourced round it can legitimately resume.

  **Contract requirement — step (2)'s clear must itself be conditioned on the resumed token, not
  unconditional.** Overlapping attempts resuming the *same* `resume_token` A (the same heartbeat-loss
  scenario as the paused-return path above) can otherwise race past each other: one attempt clears
  A's envelope and, per the paused-return path, publishes the *next* round's pause under a new token
  B; the slower attempt, still executing step (2) for A, then performs its own unconditional
  clear-and-consume write — which clears B's freshly-published envelope and can discard an answer a
  client has already submitted and had accepted for B, stranding that submission. **The clear-and-consume
  write must be a conditional `UPDATE` guarded on `resume_token == acknowledged_resume_token`
  (the same `update_job_if_resume_token_matches` primitive from §4.4, reused for this write rather
  than a bespoke second guard) — never a blind multi-field `update_job`.** A failed match (the
  guard fires because a different round is now active) is not an error to raise: it is proof this
  attempt is stale, and the activity must treat it exactly like a losing paused-return attempt —
  reload the job record's current state and proceed from whatever round is actually active rather
  than re-attempting its own now-invalid clear.
  **Contract requirement — the consumed batch must survive this activity's own terminal write, not
  just step (2)'s job-record update.** Moving the consumed batch into the job record's
  `resolved_questions` field at step (2) is not sufficient by itself: once `wait_pra` finally
  reports `"completed"` (no more rounds), this same `document_production_activity` reaches its
  existing terminal persistence (`temporal/activities.py:335-364`), which rebuilds `merged =
  _merge_context(context, context_update)` from the **original synthesized `context`** (threaded in
  from the synthesis phase, §4.3.1's precondition) and then unconditionally writes
  `resolved_questions=list(merged.get("resolved_questions") or [])`
  (`temporal/activities.py:346,364`) — overwriting whatever step (2) already persisted for this job
  with whatever `context`/`context_update` happens to carry, which today is nothing:
  `context["resolved_questions"]` is never populated anywhere in `planning_team` (`orchestrator.py`
  only reads it, per its own "intentionally a no-op today" comment at
  `temporal/activities.py:336-342`). Left as-is, every clarification decision a human made through
  this contract's pause/resume path would be silently discarded from the handoff and the job
  record's own `resolved_questions` the moment the job completes. **This activity must hydrate the
  accumulated consumed answer batches (across every resumed round for this job) into
  `context`/`context_update`'s `resolved_questions` before the terminal write** — e.g. by reading
  them back from the job record (the durable store step (2) already wrote them to) and merging into
  `context_update` ahead of the `_merge_context` call — so the terminal `update_job(...,
  resolved_questions=...)` preserves rather than clobbers them.

  **The durable consumed batches are answer-submission-shaped, not already `AnsweredQuestion`-shaped
  — hydrating them as-is produces malformed `resolved_questions` entries.** What step (2) persists is
  the wire-format submission (`question_id`, `selected_option_id`/`selected_option_ids`, `other_text`
  — `shared/hitl/models.py:70-78`) plus whatever the validator itself adds; `planning_team`'s own
  `AnsweredQuestion` (`models.py:237-244`), which `resolved_questions`/downstream decision rendering
  actually expect, requires `question_text` and a populated `selected_answer`. Hydrating that batch
  directly leaves `selected_answer` empty for every multi-select answer (only `selected_option_ids`
  is populated on those, never a computed label).

  **Correction — `question_text` is *not* among the missing fields when the mandated shared
  validator is used; only the computed answer text is.** An earlier draft of this section claimed the
  persisted batch "has no `question_text` field at all," reasoning from `AnswerSubmission`'s own
  model fields. That is wrong for the path this contract actually mandates:
  `shared.hitl.validation.validate_answers` — the validator §4.1 requires Planning's route to reuse —
  builds `text_by_qid` from the round's `pending_questions` and stamps `"question_text"` into **every**
  dict it returns (`validation.py:106-118`), precisely so a later resume can match by text rather
  than re-asking. A route that persists the validator's return value (as this contract requires)
  therefore already has `question_text` durably attached to each answer. **Contract requirement,
  narrowing (a) and (b) below:** the conversion step's job is to compute `selected_answer` from the
  selected option label(s) and to carry provenance (below) — **not** to recover a `question_text` the
  validator already supplied. #7445-B must read `question_text` from the persisted batch itself,
  and must not build a `pending_questions` lookup whose only purpose is to re-derive it. The
  requirements below still hold for everything other than `question_text`: an option-label lookup is
  genuinely needed for `selected_answer`, and that lookup does still have to happen at resume time,
  before the round's `pending_questions` is cleared.

  **Contract requirement:**
  each consumed `AnswerSubmission` must be converted into an enriched record — looking up the
  matching persisted `pending_questions` entry by `question_id` for its `question_text`/options, and
  computing `selected_answer` from the selected option label(s) (joining multiple labels, and
  substituting `other_text` for an `"other"` selection), mirroring PRA's own `apply_answers`
  conversion already documented in this contract
  (`product_requirements_analysis_agent/user_communication.py:210-219`, §4.1) rather than
  reinventing a third version of the same label-resolution logic.

  **Two further corrections to that conversion, both load-bearing:**

  **(a) `planning_team.models.AnsweredQuestion` does not declare `question_text` at all —
  constructing it with that field silently drops the value.** The model's actual fields are only
  `question_id`, `selected_option_id`, `selected_option_ids`, `selected_answer`, `other_text`
  (`models.py:237-244`) — no `question_text`. Under Pydantic's default extra-field handling, passing
  `question_text=...` to this model either raises (if a stricter `extra="forbid"` config is ever
  added) or is silently dropped from `model_dump()` (the default `extra="ignore"`) — either way, the
  "proper `AnsweredQuestion`" this requirement describes cannot actually carry `question_text`
  through as specified, and the handoff would still lack the identity downstream coverage needs even
  after this whole fix. **Contract requirement:** #7445-B must add a `question_text` field to
  `planning_team.models.AnsweredQuestion` itself (the model this contract's `resolved_questions`
  are stored as), or this conversion step must persist an explicitly enriched
  dict/second model that retains `question_text` alongside the `AnsweredQuestion` fields — not an
  unmodified `AnsweredQuestion` instance, which structurally cannot hold it.

  **(b) The lookup this conversion depends on happens too late — resume step (2) already clears
  `pending_questions` by the time terminal hydration runs, and a later round can overwrite it before
  then too.** This conversion is described as happening at *terminal* hydration (just before the
  final `update_job`), reading `pending_questions` to resolve labels — but §4.3's resume-path step
  (2) atomically *clears* `pending_questions` as part of consuming each round (it is part of the
  same pause envelope this contract clears on every successful resume), and by the time a job
  reaches its terminal write, `pending_questions` reflects only whatever the *last* round left
  behind (or nothing, if the last round cleared it too) — the question text/option labels for every
  *earlier* consumed round are already gone by the time this conversion tries to read them. Deferring
  conversion to the terminal write therefore cannot reliably reconstruct `selected_answer` for any
  round but the most recent one. **Contract requirement:** the `AnswerSubmission`-to-enriched-record
  conversion must happen at *resume time* — inside step (2), using that round's still-current
  `pending_questions` before it is cleared — and the already-enriched record (not the raw
  `AnswerSubmission`) is what step (2) persists into `resolved_questions`/wherever the durable
  consumed batches live; the terminal-write hydration described above then only needs to *read back*
  already-enriched records, never re-derive labels from question metadata that may no longer exist.

  **(c) Converting only the *submitted* batch silently drops every question PRA answered by
  default.** *(Scope: for a PRA-sourced round this is a correctness backstop, not the common case —
  §4.1 establishes every such question carries `"required": True`, so a legitimately resumable round
  leaves nothing omitted. It governs any round that does reach the conversion with an unanswered
  question, whether from a future producer that emits optional questions or from a malformed round
  the pause-assembly checks did not reject.)* The resume-path precondition permits an *optional*
  question to be omitted from the submitted batch — `validate_answers`'s `required_ids -
  answered_ids` check only requires required questions, and PRA's own `apply_answers`
  (`user_communication.py:248-260`) supplies a default-flagged `AnsweredQuestion` for every question
  with no matching submitted entry. Because
  this conversion step (above) only converts entries present in the *submitted* `AnswerSubmission`
  batch, an all-optional or partially-omitted round produces no enriched record at all for the
  omitted questions — an empty batch yields zero `resolved_questions` entries for that round even
  though PRA actually recorded (defaulted) decisions for every one of them. The resulting handoff is
  inconsistent with the spec PRA actually generated (which reflects the defaults PRA applied), and
  any downstream coverage check that consults `resolved_questions` to avoid re-asking an
  already-answered question would re-ask one PRA already defaulted. **Contract requirement:** step
  (2)'s conversion must produce an enriched record for **every** question in the round's persisted
  `pending_questions`, not only the ones present in the submitted batch — for a question with no
  matching submitted entry, synthesize the same default `AnsweredQuestion` PRA's own `apply_answers`
  would produce (the question's `is_default`-flagged option, or its highest-confidence option absent
  one — mirroring `get_default_option`, `user_communication.py:265-280`, already cited in this
  contract), so Planning's own `resolved_questions` matches what PRA actually applied rather than
  only what the client explicitly chose to submit.

  **Synthesizing the default value alone is not enough — the enriched record must also carry that
  it *is* a default, or it becomes indistinguishable from a human-selected answer.** PRA's own
  `apply_all_defaults`/`apply_answers` (`user_communication.py:160-182,247-260`, already cited in
  this contract) constructs its default-flagged `AnsweredQuestion` with `was_default=True` (and,
  where applicable, `was_auto_answered`, `rationale`, `confidence` carried from the chosen option) —
  fields that record *why* this particular answer was chosen, not just what it is. This contract's
  own earlier fix (§4.3, requirement (a) above) mandates adding `question_text` to
  `planning_team.models.AnsweredQuestion` so the enriched record can carry it, but names only that
  one field; `was_default`/`was_auto_answered`/`rationale`/`confidence` remain absent from the model
  this contract stores `resolved_questions` as. Without them, a synthesized default and a genuine
  human selection produce structurally identical records in the handoff and audit history — a
  reviewer or downstream consumer reading `resolved_questions` cannot tell "PRA defaulted this
  because the human skipped it" from "the human deliberately chose this option," even though this
  entire synthesis step exists specifically to represent the former accurately. **Contract
  requirement:** extend the same model change requirement (a) already mandates — add
  `was_default`/`was_auto_answered`/`rationale`/`confidence` to `planning_team.models.AnsweredQuestion`
  (or the enriched dict/second-model alternative (a) already permits) alongside `question_text`, and
  populate them from the synthesized default (or, for a submitted answer, from whatever provenance
  the submission itself carries) at the same resume-time conversion step this section already
  requires.

  **Hydrating `context`/`context_update` is not sufficient on its own to fix the handoff package —
  the `handoff.setdefault` call is a no-op against an already-populated key.** `DocumentProductionAgent.run`
  constructs `HandoffPackage` without ever setting `resolved_questions` explicitly (`agent.py:147-157`),
  so it takes the Pydantic model's own default — an empty list — meaning the serialized
  `handoff_package` dict already *has* a `resolved_questions` key (populated with `[]`) by the time
  `document_production_activity` reaches `handoff.setdefault("resolved_questions",
  list(merged.get("resolved_questions") or []))` (`temporal/activities.py:346`). `dict.setdefault`
  only sets a key when it is *absent*; here it is present (as `[]`), so this call is a permanent
  no-op regardless of what `merged["resolved_questions"]` now hydrates to — the top-level job field
  can end up correctly preserved while the handoff package itself stays empty. **Contract
  requirement:** this activity must explicitly assign or merge the hydrated batch into
  `handoff["resolved_questions"]` (e.g. `handoff["resolved_questions"] =
  list(merged.get("resolved_questions") or [])`, an unconditional assignment, not a `setdefault`)
  before persisting, so the handoff package built from the same `merged` dict carries the actual
  human decisions instead of an empty list.
- *Invariants:* A resume is applied at most once per `resume_token` *as reflected in this
  contract's own job record and workflow state* — re-invocation with an already-consumed token must
  not re-apply answers or re-run already-completed work there (idempotent resume from this
  contract's own perspective; see open risk 4 below for the external-delivery caveat this does not
  cover). No resume path may submit a second external PRA job for the same Planning job. A resumed
  round's answer_callback never returns an answer belonging to a different `resume_token`.
  Because this activity is retryable (§4.3.1), a retry that lands *after* step (1) but before step
  (2) must not resubmit the answers blindly — it must first reconcile against PRA's current
  `pending_questions` (a status GET). **This reconciliation must compare full question identity
  (`id` *and* `question_text` together), never `id` alone.** PRA's own question parser falls back
  to a positional `q{index}` id when a question's own `id` is missing
  (`product_requirements_analysis_agent/question_processing.py:773,805,821`), and PRA's answers
  route validates only `id` membership in the *current* `pending_questions`
  (`api/routes/product_analysis.py:262-275`) — it has no per-round or version identifier. So a
  retry that checks only "is `q0` still pending" cannot tell "PRA already applied my answer and
  moved on" apart from "PRA advanced to an unrelated later round that happens to reuse `q0` for a
  different question" — reconciling by id alone risks silently applying round *N*'s stale answer
  content to round *N+1*'s differently-scoped question, which PRA's id-only validation would
  accept without complaint. Comparing the *full* `(id, question_text)` pair against what this pause
  round persisted **narrows, but does not eliminate,** the ambiguity — and the comparison **must be
  over the complete persisted `pending_questions` set as one unit, never per-question.** A
  per-question check is unsafe for a multi-question round: if the persisted round paused on
  `[q0, q1]` and a retry's status GET finds PRA now reports `[q0 (same text), q1 (different
  text)]` — PRA has silently advanced `q1` to a new question while `q0`'s id/text pair happens to
  still match — a per-question rule would find "`q0` matches" and conclude PRA is still on the old
  round, resubmitting the *entire* persisted batch; PRA's id-only answer validation
  (`api/routes/product_analysis.py:262-275`) then accepts the stale `q1` answer against the new
  question with no error. **Contract requirement:** treat this as one equality check over the
  complete persisted round — every `(id, question_text)` pair PRA currently reports must match,
  **as a multiset (a list with occurrence counts), never a set**, every pair this pause round
  persisted — before concluding "PRA is still waiting on exactly this round, safe to (re-)submit."
  **Set equality is the wrong comparison: PRA's own question parser does not enforce unique ids and
  accepts explicit duplicates** (`question_processing.py`'s parser has no uniqueness check), so a
  set collapses duplicate `(id, question_text)` pairs before comparing — a persisted two-question
  round with a duplicated pair and a later, genuinely different one-question round that happens to
  carry the same single pair would compare equal under set semantics (both sets are `{pair}`), even
  though the actual questions differ in count and the round has clearly advanced; the retry would
  then incorrectly resubmit the stale batch. Comparing as an ordered multiset/canonical list
  (including how many times each pair occurs) does not have this collapsing problem. Any partial
  difference (even a single question's id, text, or occurrence count changed, added, or missing)
  must be treated as advancement — proceed straight to step (2), submitting nothing — never as "the
  unchanged questions are still safe to resubmit." This still leaves the residual risk below when
  the *entire* multiset is identical across rounds.

  **Comparing only `(id, question_text)` misses a round change that keeps both identical but alters
  the question's options or multiplicity — PRA's status response exposes exactly that metadata, and
  this reconciliation must use it.** A later PRA round can reuse the same `id` and `question_text`
  (a plausible LLM re-ask, not only the fallback-collision case above) while changing the offered
  `options` list or the question's `allow_multiple` flag — both fields are already present in
  `get_product_analysis_status`'s response (the same `pending_questions` shape this contract
  persists and reconciles against elsewhere, §4.1). Under an `(id, question_text)`-only comparison
  this counts as "unchanged," so the retry resubmits the persisted round's stale
  `selected_option_id`/`selected_option_ids` against the *new* round's options. Two ways that goes
  wrong, both real given this contract's own strengthened validation (§4.1): if an option id is
  reused with a different label, the stale selection is a *structurally valid* id for the new round
  and the strengthened validator accepts it — silently applying the human's decision to a visually
  different choice than the one they actually saw and picked; if the old option id no longer exists
  in the new round's options, the strengthened validator correctly rejects the POST as an unknown
  option id, and — because `wait_for_product_analysis_completion`'s poll loop has no failure branch
  for a rejected submission (already established above) — polling simply stalls until `MAX_POLL_WAIT`
  expires rather than surfacing a clean error. **Contract requirement:** the reconciliation equality
  check must compare a canonical form of the *complete* question shape — `id`, `question_text`,
  *and* the full `options` list (each option's `id` and `label`, **preserving each option's original
  position** — see the order-sensitivity correction below, which supersedes any earlier notion of
  canonicalizing/sorting option order here), and `allow_multiple` — not only the `(id, question_text)`
  pair. Any difference in any of these fields, for any question in the round, must be treated as
  advancement exactly like an id/text change is treated above: proceed straight to step (2),
  submitting nothing, rather than resubmitting a selection that may no longer correspond to what the
  new round actually offers.

  **Correction — option order is not safe to canonicalize away; it is semantically load-bearing for
  default resolution.** An earlier draft of this requirement suggested sorting the `options` list
  before comparing, mirroring this contract's own canonicalization of *answer batches* elsewhere
  (§4.3) — but that mirroring is wrong here: an answer batch's ordering is genuinely arbitrary
  (nothing reads meaning from *which* entry a client listed first), while a question's *options*
  ordering is not. `get_default_option` (`user_communication.py:265-280`, already cited in this
  contract for the synthesized-default requirement above) returns the *first* `is_default`-flagged
  option via `next((opt for opt in q.options if opt.is_default), None)` — and PRA's own option parser
  permits more than one option to carry `is_default: true` (an existing multi-select question
  definition already relies on exactly this shape). When two rounds carry the identical set of
  options — same ids, same labels, same `is_default` flags — but in a different order, sorting them
  into a canonical order before comparing would correctly call them "identical" by every field-level
  check above, while the *actual* default PRA applies (first `is_default` in *its* current order) and
  the default this contract's own reconciliation/synthesis logic would compute (first `is_default` in
  whatever order this comparison canonicalized to) can silently diverge — the same
  `resolved_questions`-misrepresents-what-PRA-decided failure mode the `is_default`/`confidence`
  correction above exists to prevent, reopened by canonicalizing away the one signal (order) that
  disambiguates which of several `is_default` options actually wins. **Contract requirement,
  superseding the sorted-order suggestion above:** compare the `options` list *positionally* — option
  *N* in the persisted round must equal option *N* in the current round (id, label, `is_default`,
  `confidence`, in that same position) — not as a canonicalized/sorted set. A reordering of otherwise
  identical options is itself a difference and must be treated as advancement, exactly like every
  other field change this comparison already treats that way.

  **The canonical identity must also cover every other field this contract's own pending-question
  shape exposes to the client, not only the fields already named above.** PRA's status response —
  the same shape this reconciliation already reads from — additionally carries each question's
  `context` and `recommendation`, and each option's `rationale` (`convert_to_pending_questions`,
  `user_communication.py:109-157`, already cited in this contract as the shape this pause envelope
  persists). None of these change which option a client is structurally permitted to select, but all
  three are exactly the explanatory text a human reads *before* choosing — the context framing the
  question, the recommendation nudging toward an option, the rationale justifying a specific choice.
  A later round can keep every field already covered by this comparison identical while silently
  rewriting any of these three — the retry then classifies the round as unchanged and resubmits a
  decision that was genuinely made (by whatever answered the *original* round, human or default)
  under explanatory text the current round no longer shows. This is a narrower harm than a
  structurally wrong answer (the selected option id is still valid against the current round), but it
  is real: the persisted `resolved_questions` record misattributes a decision to reasoning the human
  never actually saw. **Contract requirement:** include `context`, `recommendation`, and each
  option's `rationale` in the canonical comparison alongside every field already required above — a
  difference in any of them is advancement, exactly as for every other field this section covers.

  **`source` is part of the same shape and equally omitted so far.** The status route's own
  reconstruction of `PendingQuestion` also sets `source=q.get("source", "spec_review")`
  (`api/routes/product_analysis.py:211`, the same shared `PendingQuestion` shape §4.1 already treats
  as this reconciliation's data source) — a field this comparison has not named at all. A later round
  that changes only a question's origin (e.g. `spec_review` to some other source PRA's own logic can
  assign) while keeping every field already covered identical is, by this comparison, indistinguishable
  from the original round, even though the client-visible question record has genuinely advanced.
  **Contract requirement:** include `source` in the canonical comparison alongside every field already
  required above, for the same reason and with the same treatment — a difference is advancement.
  Where a durable PRA-side round/version identifier becomes available (§5's open risks already flag
  this as the only complete closure for the underlying ambiguity), it would replace this whole
  field-by-field comparison outright rather than requiring yet more fields enumerated by hand; until
  then, this contract's position is that every client-visible semantic field belongs in the identity,
  not a hand-picked subset of it.

  **This same rollout changes PRA's own status serialization (adding `allow_multiple`, §4.1) — a
  rolling deployment of that change can make the identical underlying round compare as "different"
  purely from which replica served it, with no `apply_answers` call involved at all.** If the status
  service's old and new code serve concurrently during a rolling deploy, the *same* persisted round
  can be read once through an old replica (no `allow_multiple` key at all) and again, later, through
  a new replica (the field present and populated) — the canonical comparison above would see a
  field-level difference for a round PRA never actually advanced, misclassify it as advancement, and
  the resumed activity would skip its own submission (or, in the achievable-application-proxy case
  above, incorrectly treat the mismatch as confirmation) against a round the client is still
  legitimately answering. **Contract requirement:** this specific rollout — the status-serialization
  change (`allow_multiple`) — must not be exposed to live traffic as a rolling,
  mixed-version deployment; either deploy it as a single atomic cutover (no old/new replica overlap
  serving this route), or have the reconciliation comparison normalize both the persisted round and
  the current status read under one fixed, explicit schema version before comparing field-by-field,
  so a version skew during rollout cannot itself manufacture a false round-advancement signal. This is
  narrower in scope than, and does not require, the general worker-versioning machinery this contract
  uses elsewhere (§4.3.2) — it is a rollout-sequencing constraint on one specific PRA-side change, not
  a new compatibility primitive.

  **`required` and the option metadata default-selection depends on must also be part of this
  canonical identity — a round can keep `id`/`question_text`/`options`/`allow_multiple` unchanged
  while still changing meaning through these fields.** Two further ways a "same-shaped" round is not
  actually the same round: (1) `required` is part of the round's client-visible contract, and a
  round whose `required` flag differs from what was persisted is by definition not the round that
  was persisted — a batch built against the old flag can be structurally incomplete against the new
  round's own `required_ids - answered_ids` check (§4.1), so resubmitting it verbatim fails PRA's
  route outright, degrading to the same stalled-polling failure mode already established above for a
  rejected resubmission. (Today this is defensive rather than live: §4.1 establishes
  `convert_to_pending_questions` stamps `"required": True` on every question, so a PRA-sourced
  round's flag does not vary in practice — it is included for the same reason every other
  client-visible field is, since a comparison that silently omits a field cannot detect a producer
  that later starts varying it.) (2) each option's `is_default`/`confidence` feeds this contract's own synthesized
  default for an omitted optional question (§4.3's `get_default_option`-mirroring requirement) — if
  the new round's default-flagged option or confidence ranking differs from what was persisted while
  every other field stays identical, Planning's synthesized default and PRA's own live default
  (computed from the *current* round's metadata when it actually applies the round) can diverge,
  producing a `resolved_questions` entry that misrepresents what PRA actually decided for that
  question. **Contract requirement:** extend the canonical comparison to include each question's
  `required` flag and each option's `is_default`/`confidence`, alongside `id`/`question_text`/
  `options`/`allow_multiple` above — a difference in any of these fields is advancement, exactly as
  for the fields already covered.

  **Multiset comparison only fixes reconciliation — it does not make a round with duplicate question
  ids answerable at all, and duplicates should never reach a client as a pause round in the first
  place.** Every validator downstream of this reconciliation keys by `question_id` alone, not by the
  full `(id, question_text)` pair: required/answered-set membership checks (§4.1), the option lookup
  used to validate a selected option, and PRA's own `apply_answers` (which builds a single
  `submitted_by_id` dict, `user_communication.py`) all collapse two questions sharing an id into one
  entry. A round exposing duplicate ids is therefore not just a reconciliation edge case — it is
  structurally unanswerable: a single answer satisfies "the id" for both questions regardless of
  which one the human actually meant, or the same answer content gets misapplied to both. **Contract
  requirement:** reject duplicate question ids when parsing or publishing the round — at the point
  `pending_questions` is assembled for a pause (whether by PRA's own parser or this contract's own
  pause-creation step) — rather than merely detecting the collision later during multiset
  reconciliation, which narrows the *retry-safety* problem but does nothing for the *answerability*
  problem a duplicate-id round has regardless of retries.

  **The same duplicate-id problem exists one level down, inside each question's own offered
  options, and this contract's duplicate-*question*-id rejection above does nothing to catch it.**
  PRA's option parser (`question_processing.py:858-883`, `parse_question_option`) has no uniqueness
  check on option ids either — like the question-id fallback, a missing option id defaults to
  `opt{index}`, and nothing rejects two explicit, identical option ids within one question's options
  list. Every downstream consumer of a selected option id collapses that duplication the same way
  the question-id case does: `shared.hitl.validation.validate_answers`'s own membership check builds
  `options_by_qid` as `{o.get("id") for o in options}` (`validation.py:80`), a set that silently
  discards the second entry; PRA's own `apply_answers` resolves a selected id via
  `next((o for o in q.options if o.id == opt_id), None)` (`user_communication.py:217,230`), which
  always returns the *first* option matching that id. A question offering two options that happen to
  share an id but carry different labels is therefore unanswerable in the same way a duplicate
  *question* id is: the client's selection is silently resolved against whichever option the
  validator/`apply_answers` happens to pick, never provably the one the human actually chose.
  **Contract requirement:** reject duplicate option ids within a single question's `options` list at
  the same point `pending_questions` is assembled for a pause — alongside, not instead of, the
  duplicate-question-id check above — so a round with an internally ambiguous question never reaches
  a client as answerable in the first place.

  **Rejecting duplicates alone still permits an explicit blank option id, which is structurally
  unanswerable for a different reason.** `parse_question_option`'s own fallback only applies when the
  `id` key is *absent* — an explicit `id: ""` is a valid string and passes through unchanged
  (`_require_string_field`, above), so a question can offer a displayed option whose id is the empty
  string, unique among its siblings and therefore invisible to the duplicate check just added. For a
  single-select question, selecting that option produces `selected_option_id=""`; the shared
  validator's own falsy check (`validation.py:86-100`: `"other"` branch, `elif` non-blank-`selected_option_id`
  branch, `elif not other_text` reject-as-no-decision branch) treats an empty string exactly like "no
  option selected" and rejects the submission as incomplete rather than recognizing it as a
  deliberate choice of that specific (blank-id) option — the option is displayed but structurally
  impossible to select. **Contract requirement:** reject a question whose `options` list contains any
  option with a missing or blank (empty-after-stripping) `id`, at the same pause-assembly validation
  boundary as the duplicate checks above.

  **A blank id is not the only structurally reserved value — `"other"` is a synthetic, validator-owned
  identifier that pause assembly can still publish as a real option's id.** §4.1's validator treats
  any `selected_option_id`/`selected_option_ids` entry equal to `"other"` as the synthetic free-text
  choice — special-cased to require `other_text` rather than being checked against the question's
  stored options at all (§4.1, above). Nothing in PRA's own option parser or this contract's
  pause-assembly checks stops a question from offering a *real*, displayed option whose explicit `id`
  also happens to be `"other"`. A client selecting that displayed option produces
  `selected_option_id="other"` — which the validator now treats as the synthetic choice, unexpectedly
  requiring `other_text` to be non-blank even though the human selected a labeled option, not free
  text — and PRA's `apply_answers` applies the free-text branch (or rejects the answer as incomplete
  if `other_text` is blank) rather than resolving the option the human actually picked. **Contract
  requirement:** reject a question whose `options` list contains an explicit option with `id ==
  "other"` at the same pause-assembly validation boundary as the checks above — `"other"` is reserved
  for the validator's own synthetic free-text path and must never be assignable to a real, displayed
  option.

  **Correction — this blanket rejection would also reject PRA's own legitimate, machine-generated
  free-text placeholder, making every options-less PRA question unpublishable.** PRA itself
  synthesizes exactly `{"id": "other", "label": "Provide answer in text field"}` as the *sole* entry
  in `options` whenever an `OpenQuestion` has none (`convert_to_pending_questions`,
  `user_communication.py:109-142`, `if not options: options = [{"id": "other", "label": "Provide
  answer in text field"}]`) — this is the mechanism PRA uses to represent a free-text-only question at
  all, not an authoring mistake. By the time Planning reads the status payload, this synthesized entry
  is structurally identical to an authored option with the same shape; the rejection above, applied
  without qualification, would reject every such question and make free-text-only PRA questions
  impossible to publish through this contract's pause path. **Contract requirement, narrowing the
  rejection above:** exempt the specific single-option shape PRA generates for this purpose — a
  question whose entire `options` list is exactly one entry with `id == "other"` and `label ==
  "Provide answer in text field"` — from this rejection; continue rejecting `id == "other"` in every
  other shape (any option list containing `"other"` alongside one or more *other* entries, or a
  differently-labeled solitary `"other"` entry that isn't PRA's own generated placeholder), since
  those shapes are exactly the ambiguous-with-a-real-authored-option case this rejection exists to
  close.

  **Rejecting blank option ids does nothing for a blank option label — PRA's parser accepts an
  explicit empty label just as readily as an empty id.** `parse_question_option` applies the same
  `_require_string_field` pattern to `label` as it does to `id` (`question_processing.py:874-883`),
  so an option can carry a valid, unique, non-blank `id` while its `label` is missing or an explicit
  `""`. Such an option is uniquely selectable — it passes every id-based check above — but displays no
  text a human can evaluate, the same unintelligible-choice failure mode the blank-`question_text`
  rejection below exists to prevent, just one level down at the option rather than the question.
  **Contract requirement:** reject a question whose `options` list contains any option with a missing
  or blank (empty-after-stripping) `label`, at the same pause-assembly validation boundary as every
  other check in this section.

  **A missing or blank `question_text` is not merely a reconciliation-collision risk (§4.3's own
  citation of this same fallback) — it can also reach a client as a pause round with no
  human-readable prompt at all.** `_require_string_field(q_data, "question_text", "")`
  (`question_processing.py:822`) defaults an absent `question_text` to `""`, and an explicit `""` is
  equally valid — either way the question can be persisted and exposed to the client carrying no
  prompt text whatsoever, alongside whatever options and metadata it does have. A human confronted
  with an unintelligible, textless question has nothing to answer meaningfully; the workflow then
  waits on `wait_condition` indefinitely (§5 risk 1's already-flagged unbounded wait) for a decision
  no one can actually make. **Contract requirement:** reject a question whose `question_text` is
  missing or blank (empty-after-stripping) at the same pause-assembly validation boundary as the
  duplicate-id and blank-option-id checks above, rather than merely treating the fallback as a
  reconciliation-comparison hazard once it has already been published.

  **A question's own `id` needs the same blank check already required of option ids — an explicit
  `question.id == ""` passes every check above unrejected.** `_require_string_field`'s fallback
  applies only when the `id` key is *absent*; an explicit `id: ""` is a valid string and is not
  a duplicate of anything else in the round, so it is invisible to the duplicate-question-id check
  above just as a blank option id was invisible to the duplicate-option-id check. A question keyed by
  the empty string cannot be addressed by `.../auto-answer/{question_id}` or any other route that
  paths on the id, supplies an unstable empty key to UI answer-tracking maps and this contract's own
  reconciliation, and collapses with any other blank-id question a round might contain (nothing
  prevents more than one, since each blank id is technically "unique" only in the sense that
  duplicate-detection based on equality treats them as duplicates of each other — a further reason
  this is unsafe, not a mitigating one). **Contract requirement:** reject a question whose own `id` is
  missing or blank (empty-after-stripping) at the same pause-assembly validation boundary as every
  other check in this section — the same non-blank requirement already applied to option ids, applied
  here to the question id itself.

  **This is not a complete fix.** `id` still has an unaddressed fallback problem the
  blank-`question_text` rejection above does not reach: `_require_string_field(q_data, "id",
  f"q{index}")` (`question_processing.py:821`) defaults a *missing* `id` to a positional `q{index}`
  — a non-blank string this contract's own uniqueness/blank checks above happily accept — so two
  separate rounds can independently fall back to the *same* `q{index}` id at the same position while
  each carrying a distinct (and, after the fix above, always non-blank) `question_text`. This
  contract's blank-`question_text` rejection closes the narrower case where both fields *also*
  independently defaulted to an empty/generated value in a way that made the pair trivially
  identical; it does not close the case where two rounds' genuinely different, non-blank
  `question_text` values coincide by LLM happenstance while sharing a fallback `id` — no client-side
  comparison over PRA's reported fields can distinguish that from a genuinely still-pending question.
  Comparing the full pair (and now the wider canonical shape above) is strictly better than comparing
  `id` alone — it catches every collision where any covered field actually differs, which is the
  common case — but it is a harm-reduction measure, not a proof. This folds into, rather than sits
  beside, the open risk already flagged below: **only a durable PRA-side round/version identifier or
  delivery receipt closes this completely**, and that is out of `planning_team`'s boundary to
  provide. #7445-B inherits this residual risk knowingly; it is not resolved by this spec.

**A failed status read is not confirmation.** `get_product_analysis_status` returns `None` on
*any* GET failure (`adapters/product_analysis.py:51-58` — "Returns `None` on failure"), not only
when the job or question is genuinely gone. Treating "no match" (§5's reconciliation rule above) as
proof PRA already applied the answer would misinterpret a transient status-read failure — after an
ambiguous prior POST — as confirmation, clearing the local pause envelope and consuming the durable
answer batch while PRA may still be sitting there waiting for it, with nothing left locally to
retry from. **Contract requirement:** reconciliation must distinguish "the status call itself
failed" from "the status call succeeded and the question is structurally absent/mismatched." Only
the latter is treated as confirmation (proceed to step (2)); a `None`/failed status response, or
any other structurally invalid response, must cause the activity to raise (so `SAFE_RETRY`
re-attempts the whole reconciliation later) rather than proceed as if confirmed.

**Correction — even a *successful* status read reporting the question gone is not proof PRA applied
it either; PRA's own submit route clears the pause synchronously, before its background loop ever
runs `apply_answers`.** The distinction drawn above (failed status call vs. successful call reporting
structural absence) assumes a successful, empty response means PRA's own application step has already
run. It has not, necessarily: `submit_product_analysis_answers`'s route handler calls
`store_submit_answers` (`shared/job_store.py`'s `submit_answers` wrapper,
`job_service_client.py:811-823`), which atomically clears `pending_questions`/`waiting_for_answers`
and appends to `submitted_answers` **synchronously, inside the POST request itself** — before PRA's
own background `communicate_with_user` wait loop (`user_communication.py:88-106`, polling every
`OPEN_QUESTIONS_POLL_INTERVAL`) has necessarily woken, read `get_submitted_answers`, and run
`apply_answers` to actually resolve the questions. A status GET issued immediately after a successful
POST — exactly the shape a reconciliation retry performs — can therefore observe `pending_questions`
already empty and `waiting_for_answers` already false purely because the *route* cleared them, with
`apply_answers` not yet having run at all; if PRA's worker then crashes before its background loop
reaches `apply_answers`, the questions are durably marked answered-and-gone at PRA's job-record level
even though no answer was ever actually applied to them. **Contract requirement:** this reconciliation
cannot rely on PRA's `pending_questions` becoming empty as an applied-answer receipt at all — that
signal fires at POST-acceptance time, not apply time, and PRA exposes no distinct applied/round
receipt today. #7445-B must either add such a receipt to PRA (out of `planning_team`'s boundary to do
unilaterally) or accept this as a further open risk (§5, risk 6, below): a reconciliation retry that
finds PRA's questions gone cannot distinguish "already applied" from "accepted but not yet applied,
and possibly never will be" without a PRA-side signal this contract cannot manufacture. This narrows,
rather than replaces, the failed-vs-succeeded distinction above — a failed status read is still never
confirmation — but a succeeded one showing absence confirms only *acceptance*, not *application*, and
this spec cannot close that gap from Planning's side alone.

**Ordering requirement this adds to §4.3:** clearing the local pause envelope / marking a batch
consumed must never happen *before* PRA has durably applied that batch. Because `submit_answers`
(§4.3) already establishes that the job record's answer batch — not the workflow's in-memory
`_submitted_answers` — is the durable source of truth, and because a worker crash between "PRA
applied the answer" and "the pause envelope is cleared" is recoverable (retry re-checks PRA per the
reconciliation invariant above and finds it already applied), the reverse ordering is not: clearing
the envelope first and then crashing before PRA sees the answer would leave PRA still waiting with
no persisted pause to resume from, silently hanging the job.

**Correction — as worded, this ordering requirement names a precondition ("PRA has durably applied
that batch") this contract has separately established is unobservable, leaving no operation that can
ever satisfy it.** The risk-6 correction above establishes that PRA exposes no applied-answer
receipt: its `pending_questions` field clears (and any status read reporting it "gone") at POST
*acceptance* time, before PRA's background loop necessarily runs `apply_answers` — so "wait until the
status read confirms application" is not an operation Planning can perform; it can only ever observe
acceptance. An implementation that takes this ordering requirement literally is stuck between two bad
choices: block forever waiting for a confirmation signal PRA will never send, or clear on mere
acceptance and silently violate the crash-safe ordering this section exists to guarantee. **Contract
requirement, redefining what "confirmed applied" achievably means:** rather than waiting for an
application receipt that doesn't exist, treat *genuine round advancement* as the achievable proxy —
continue `wait_pra` polling (step (3) of the resume path, §4.3) until PRA's status reports either a
pending-questions round that differs from the persisted one under this contract's own canonical
comparison (§4.3's multiset/full-shape identity, above) or **successful** completion; only *that*
observation — not a bare empty/absent `pending_questions` read, which fires at acceptance — clears the
local envelope. This is sound because PRA's own `communicate_with_user` loop structurally cannot
produce a *new*, genuinely different round (or reach successful completion) without its current phase
having already consumed the prior round's submitted answers via `apply_answers` first — a later phase
raising fresh questions, or the run completing successfully, is only reachable after the earlier phase
that was waiting on this round's answers has proceeded past it. Observing forward progress is
therefore valid indirect evidence of application, where a bare "no more pending questions" read is
not. This does mean the local clear can lag slightly behind PRA's actual `apply_answers` call (by
however long PRA takes to move its own phase forward) rather than firing the instant PRA applies the
answer — an accepted latency cost, not a correctness gap, since the crash-safety property this
section protects only requires "never clear before application," never "clear immediately upon
application."

**Correction — a terminal `failed` status is not the same forward-progress evidence as a new round
or successful completion; it must not be treated as proof of application.** The redefinition above
originally included a `failed` terminal status alongside a new round and successful completion as
proxies for "PRA applied this batch." That is unsound: PRA can fail or be cancelled *after* its
answers route clears `pending_questions` (at POST-acceptance) but *before* its background
`communicate_with_user` loop reaches `apply_answers` — precisely the crash window this whole
correction exists to account for. A `failed` status observed in that window proves only that PRA
stopped, not that it consumed the batch; treating it as application evidence would clear Planning's
envelope and mark the batch resolved/consumed even though PRA never actually used it, discarding the
one durable record of what the human decided. **Contract requirement, narrowing the proxy above:**
only a genuinely different round (per the canonical comparison) or a **successful** completion status
may clear the local envelope; a `failed` (or otherwise non-successful) terminal status must not clear
it or mark the batch consumed — the resume-path activity should instead surface this as its own
failure (propagating through `_guarded`'s ordinary failure path, per this contract's other
active-status-conditional writers), leaving the durable, still-unconsumed answer batch in the job
record for whatever recovery or retry this failure triggers, rather than silently discarding it as if
it had been applied.

**A different round is evidence *something* was applied — not evidence that Planning's own persisted
batch was the thing applied.** This contract already permits PRA's public answers endpoint to be used
concurrently, independent of Planning's own signal path (§4.1/§4.3's repeated acknowledgment that a
direct PRA submission is possible). A direct caller can submit a different batch B to PRA between the
moment Planning's resume-path activity persists-and-signals its own batch A and the moment that
activity's own step (1) actually POSTs A to PRA — if B lands first and PRA applies it, `wait_pra`
observes a genuinely new round (or completion) exactly as this proxy expects, and the activity
concludes "A was applied," clears A's envelope, and records A into `resolved_questions` — while PRA's
actual artifacts reflect B, not A, for that round. The proxy correctly detects forward progress; it
cannot distinguish *whose* submission caused it. **This is not closable within this contract's
boundary:** proving "the round that just resolved was resolved specifically by batch A" requires an
acceptance identity from PRA tied to the submitted content (an idempotency/receipt key covering *what
was submitted*, not just *that something was*), which PRA does not expose — the same class of gap as
this contract's other PRA-boundary risks. This is named here as a further open risk (§5, below), not
resolved by the round-advancement proxy above; #7445-B inherits it knowingly.

**`PlanningWorkflow.submit_answers` (signal handler)**
- *Preconditions:* None on the caller — a signal handler must accept any payload without raising
  (Temporal signal handlers cannot reject a signal back to the sender).
- *Postconditions:* A payload whose `resume_token` matches `self._active_resume_token` and is the
  first such match sets `self._submitted_answers`; every other payload shape (no active pause, or
  mismatched, or duplicate token) is either buffered (no active pause yet) or silently ignored
  (mismatched or duplicate), never raises, never sets `_submitted_answers` a second time for one
  round.
- *Invariants:* `self._buffered_signals` holds at most one entry per distinct `resume_token` seen
  while no pause was active; every entry is discarded the moment a new pause is armed and its
  matching entry (if any) is applied — the dict does not accumulate stale entries *across* a
  long-running workflow's many pause rounds, since arming each new pause clears the previous
  round's leftovers.

  **This does not bound the buffer's size *within* one stretch where no pause is active at all.**
  A signal handler cannot reject a signal (§4.2's own precondition), so nothing stops a
  misconfigured or abusive client from sending arbitrarily many distinct-token `submit_answers`
  signals while the workflow is mid-`document_production_activity` with no pause armed yet, or
  during a run that completes without ever pausing — every such signal buffers as a new entry, and
  none of them are ever cleared (no pause ever arms to clear them), growing this durable
  workflow-state field without bound for the life of that execution. **Contract requirement:** cap
  `self._buffered_signals` at a small fixed size (e.g. a handful of entries), evicting the oldest
  entry when the cap is reached, or discarding a new signal outright once the cap is reached.

  **Correction — evicting is not safe on its own: it can silently drop the one legitimate signal
  among a flood of junk, and there *is* a client-visible durability guarantee to reconcile against.**
  This contract's own persist-then-signal ordering (§4.3) means the answer-submission HTTP route
  durably wrote the answer to the job record *before* sending the signal — by the time a client
  receives a successful response, its answer is already durable and the signal delivery already
  succeeded, so that client has no reason to ever retry. If eviction later discards that specific
  signal's buffered entry (oldest-eviction drops a real signal followed by junk; discard-on-full
  drops a real signal preceded by junk), and the workflow subsequently arms the matching pause, it
  finds no buffered entry for that token and waits — indefinitely, for a signal that already
  arrived and will never be resent. **Contract requirement:** arming a new pause must not rely on
  `_buffered_signals` alone — it must also check the job record's own durable `submitted_answers`
  for an entry matching the newly-armed `resume_token` (the same durable store step (2)'s
  clear-and-consume already reads from) and treat a match there exactly as a buffered-signal match,
  before concluding no early submission exists. This closes the gap the eviction cap opens: a
  legitimately durable answer is never lost even if its in-memory buffered signal was evicted, since
  the job record itself is the authoritative source `_buffered_signals` was only ever ballast for.

  **This reconciliation check must be a Temporal activity, not a job-record read performed directly
  inside the workflow.** Arming a pause happens inside `PlanningWorkflow`'s own workflow code; a
  direct job-store read there is the same class of nondeterministic-I/O violation this contract
  already corrected for the crash backstop (§4.3.1) — `workflows.py`'s own module docstring states
  the workflow body only performs external work through `workflow.execute_activity`. Simply omitting
  the check to avoid that violation is not an acceptable alternative either: it reintroduces the
  exact evicted-signal hang this whole correction exists to close. **Contract requirement:** register
  a small, separate read/reconciliation activity (e.g.
  `check_submitted_answers_activity(job_id, resume_token)`, itself following this contract's own
  worker-versioning requirement above since it too is a new activity type) that performs the durable
  `submitted_answers` lookup, and have the workflow `await workflow.execute_activity(...)` it
  immediately after arming a new pause envelope, *before* entering `wait_condition` — treating a
  match exactly as if the corresponding signal had already arrived (setting `_submitted_answers`
  directly) so `wait_condition` returns immediately rather than blocking on a signal that will never
  come.

  **This activity's own failure is undefined — an unconditional `await` on it can fail the workflow
  while the durable row still advertises an active, answerable pause.** If
  `check_submitted_answers_activity` exhausts its own retry policy (e.g. the job service is
  unavailable for the duration of that policy), an unconditional `await
  workflow.execute_activity(...)` propagates that failure and fails the *workflow* before it ever
  reaches `wait_condition` — but nothing about that failure touches the job record: `waiting_for_answers`
  is still `True`, `resume_token` still matches what the client was told, and the answer-submission
  route still accepts and durably persists submissions against it, for a workflow execution that no
  longer exists to ever act on them. This is the same class of "job record doesn't reflect the
  workflow's true state" gap this contract has already corrected for the submit activity's own
  crash/failure paths (§4.3.1) — silent from the job record's perspective, regardless of how loudly
  Temporal itself reports the failure. **Contract requirement:** this activity call must not be left
  to fail the workflow unconditionally. Wrap it the same way the submit activity's no-retry-cushion
  crash is wrapped — a bounded retry policy, and a `try/except` around the `execute_activity` call
  that, on exhaustion, invokes the same conditional `mark_planning_job_failed_activity` backstop
  (§4.3.1) before re-raising, so the job record is left `failed` (guarded by the same active-status
  conditional write, not resurrecting a state that moved on in the meantime) rather than stuck
  claiming an active pause nothing will ever resume.

  **Correction — treating this activity's failure as non-fatal ("proceed directly into
  `wait_condition` without the eviction-recovery benefit") is not a safe alternative; it is unsafe in
  exactly the scenario this activity exists to recover.** An earlier draft of this requirement offered
  a second option: log the failure and proceed to `wait_condition` anyway, relying on a subsequent
  signal. That is unsound precisely when this reconciliation was actually needed — if the legitimate
  early signal for this round was already evicted (the eviction-cap correction above) and the durable
  lookup then exhausts its retries, "proceed anyway" means the workflow blocks on `wait_condition`
  with no buffered signal, no durable-batch confirmation, and no future signal coming (the client
  already received success and has no reason to retry): the job hangs forever, and no later pause
  round can ever be reached either, since this one never resumes. **Contract requirement, removing
  the non-fatal alternative above:** the guarded-backstop path is the only acceptable treatment of
  this activity's failure — proceeding to `wait_condition` on a failed reconciliation lookup is not a
  permitted alternative. If a workflow-side retry/timer that keeps re-attempting the durable lookup
  (rather than failing outright) is preferred over the backstop, it must actually keep attempting the
  lookup until it succeeds or the workflow is otherwise terminated — never silently abandon the
  attempt and fall through to an unconfirmed wait.

  **A signal carrying a matching `resume_token` is not, by itself, proof a durable answer batch
  exists — the signal handler's own precondition is "none on the caller."** §4.2 states the signal
  handler must accept any payload without raising, since a Temporal signal handler cannot reject a
  signal back to the sender. That means any caller who knows the client-visible `resume_token` — not
  only this contract's own answer-submission route, but any direct Temporal client with signal
  access — can send `submit_answers` with a matching token and an arbitrary `answers` payload
  *without ever having persisted anything to the job record first*. The postcondition above sets
  `self._submitted_answers` directly from that payload and lets `wait_condition` return; the workflow
  then proceeds to resume `document_production_activity` with
  `acknowledged_resume_token=resume_token`, whose own precondition (§4.3) requires the job record's
  answer store to already carry a batch tagged with that token — a requirement this rogue signal
  never satisfied. Nothing in this contract defines what happens next; the resumed activity's own
  precondition is violated, and behavior is undefined. **Contract requirement:** the signal handler
  must not treat an arriving signal's payload as the authoritative answer content — it is a wake-up
  hint only. On any signal matching the active `resume_token` (first arrival, buffered-and-then-armed,
  or the reconciliation activity's own direct set above), the workflow must confirm the durable
  answer batch through `check_submitted_answers_activity` (the same reconciliation activity
  introduced above, reused here rather than adding a second one) *before* leaving `wait_condition` and
  proceeding to resume — treating "signal received" as "check the durable store," never as "the
  payload itself is the answer." If that check finds no matching durable batch (the rogue-signal
  case, or any other payload that reached the handler without a corresponding persisted write), the
  workflow must not proceed to resume; it continues waiting, exactly as if no signal had arrived at
  all, since by this contract's own invariants (§4.3) the only path that legitimately produces a
  durable batch is the answer-submission route's persist-then-signal ordering, which this rogue
  signal bypassed.

  **"Continues waiting" is not achievable without explicitly clearing the signal-handler's own
  latch — as specified, the state that satisfies `wait_condition` is never reset.** The signal
  handler's postcondition (above) sets `self._submitted_answers` on the *first* payload matching the
  active token and silently ignores every subsequent one for that same token as a duplicate.
  `wait_condition`'s predicate is `self._submitted_answers is not None`; once the rogue signal sets it,
  the predicate is already satisfied and stays satisfied — there is no "continue waiting" state to
  fall back into unless something explicitly clears it back to `None`. Worse, the first-match rule
  means a *later, genuine* HTTP submission for this same token — the one whose signal was always
  going to arrive and actually carry a durable batch — would itself be silently ignored as a
  duplicate the moment it arrives, because the rogue signal already occupied the "first match" slot.
  Left as originally worded, "continue waiting" either does not happen at all (the workflow proceeds
  on the stale non-`None` state regardless) or, if the workflow re-enters `wait_condition` on the
  same predicate, returns immediately again with nothing new to act on — and the legitimate
  submission that follows is dropped. **Contract requirement, superseding "continues waiting" above:**
  on a failed durable check, the workflow must explicitly reset `self._submitted_answers` back to
  `None` — re-arming the latch — before re-entering (or remaining in) `wait_condition`. This makes the
  next signal matching this `resume_token` a fresh first-match rather than a discarded duplicate, so a
  genuine subsequent HTTP submission (which this contract's persist-then-signal ordering guarantees
  will itself carry a durable batch and pass the same check) resumes the workflow correctly.

  **Re-arming alone still drops a genuine submission that lands during the check itself — "the next
  signal will arrive later" is false for any submission that arrived *while
  `check_submitted_answers_activity` was in flight*.** The rogue signal's `_submitted_answers` slot
  is occupied for the entire duration of that `await workflow.execute_activity(...)` call, not just
  until the check starts. A genuine client can persist its answer and send its own matching
  `submit_answers` signal at any point during that window — before the check activity returns — and
  the signal handler's first-match rule silently ignores it as a duplicate, exactly as it does for
  every other duplicate-token signal. When the in-flight check then completes and reports "no batch"
  (it read the job record *before* the genuine write landed, or the genuine write raced past it),
  re-arming the latch clears `_submitted_answers` — but the one signal that would have woken the
  workflow already arrived and was already dropped; nothing will resend it, since that client already
  received a successful response and has no reason to retry. The workflow then waits indefinitely on
  a `wait_condition` that no future signal will ever satisfy, even though the durable answer batch it
  needs has been sitting in the job record the entire time. **Contract requirement, closing this
  window:** immediately after re-arming the latch (resetting `_submitted_answers` to `None`), the
  workflow must perform *one more* `check_submitted_answers_activity` call before returning to
  `wait_condition` — not rely solely on a future signal. This second check catches exactly the case
  above: a genuine batch that was persisted (and whose signal was dropped as a duplicate) during the
  first check's flight. Only if this immediate recheck also finds no matching batch does the workflow
  actually block on `wait_condition` for a subsequent signal — at which point no submission has
  raced past this checkpoint unnoticed, so relying on the next signal to arrive is finally safe.

  No further polling loop is required beyond this one extra recheck: any submission that could have
  raced past the *first* check either lands before the second check (caught by it) or after the
  second check has already returned to `wait_condition` genuinely re-armed (caught by its own signal,
  no rogue signal blocking it this time). No additional polling primitive is required beyond this;
  re-arming otherwise relies on the genuine submission's own signal
  arriving later, exactly as it would have if the rogue signal had never preempted it.

  **This cap must be version-gated for `CodingTeamWorkflow`, whose existing histories this
  contract's mandatory extraction (§4.4) requires migrating onto the same shared state machine.**
  Unlike this contract's other behavior changes (all new, on a workflow type with no pre-existing
  histories), an eviction policy applied unconditionally to the shared component would change
  `CodingTeamWorkflow`'s own replay behavior: an in-flight history recorded *before* this cap existed
  can already contain more than the new cap's number of buffered early signals, and replaying it
  against the capped implementation can evict a token the original run retained — if that history
  also recorded a resumed-activity command keyed on the now-evicted token, the replayed workflow
  instead sits blocked in `wait_condition` waiting for a signal it already buffered under the old
  behavior, a nondeterministic replay divergence. **Contract requirement:** gate the eviction cap
  itself behind a `workflow.patched` marker for `CodingTeamWorkflow` specifically (a new patch,
  distinct from this contract's own `_CLARIFICATION_PAUSE_PATCH`) — an execution whose history
  predates the patch keeps the old unbounded-within-one-stretch buffering behavior for its own
  replay, and only executions started after the patch (Planning's new workflow included, which has
  no pre-existing histories to protect) get the capped behavior from the start.

  **The eviction-recovery reconciliation above is specified only for Planning, but the capped buffer
  it protects against is required of `CodingTeamWorkflow` too — and Coding's existing durable answer
  store is not token-keyed the way this reconciliation assumes.** §4.4 requires
  `CodingTeamWorkflow`'s existing `_buffered_signals` machinery to adopt this same cap (gated by the
  patch above), which means Coding is equally exposed to the evicted-legitimate-signal hang the
  reconciliation check exists to close — but the reconciliation requirement itself, and the
  `check_submitted_answers_activity` introduced to perform it, are described only in terms of
  Planning's job record. Coding's own durable `submitted_answers` field accumulates every posted
  batch onto one flat, unscoped list rather than storing per-`resume_token` entries
  (`hitl.py:353-377`'s own docstring: "Answers for other batches (`submitted_answers` accumulates
  across pause cycles) are for a different resume token and are skipped"; `pause_cycle.py:212,380`
  reads that same flat list) — a reconciliation check written to look up "the durable batch matching
  this `resume_token`" cannot be pointed at Coding's store unmodified, since there is no scoped entry
  to find, only an undifferentiated history filtered ad hoc at read time (`hitl.py:372-377`). Without
  an equivalent fix on the Coding side, a legitimate early Coding signal that eviction discards is
  never recovered when its pause later arms — `CodingTeamWorkflow` hangs exactly as this whole
  correction was written to prevent, just on the one workflow type this section otherwise leaves out.
  **Contract requirement:** extend the token-scoped reconciliation requirement to
  `CodingTeamWorkflow` as part of the same version-gated migration (behind the same patch marker
  above) — by tagging each Coding batch with its `resume_token` (or another durable round identity)
  at persist time, the same way this contract scopes Planning's own store (§4.3's `resume_token`
  tagging), and pointing a Coding-side `check_submitted_answers_activity` at that scoped storage.

  **Correction — filtering the existing flat history by current-question-id membership, as
  `hitl.py:372-377`'s own reentry logic already does, is not an equivalent, safe alternative to
  token-tagging here.** That id-membership filter is safe in its *original* use (resolving the
  answers belonging to the round PRA/Tech-Lead is currently re-presenting, immediately after a
  resume) precisely because it is checked against the round's own currently-pending ids at that
  moment. Reused as a *reconciliation* check — "does a durable answer already exist for this
  newly-armed token" — it loses that safety: `submitted_answers` accumulates across every round for
  the job's lifetime, explicit question ids are not guaranteed unique across rounds (the same
  `q{index}`-fallback and LLM-coincidence collision this contract already documents for Planning's
  own reconciliation, §4.3), and an id-membership filter has no way to distinguish "this batch
  answers the *current* round" from "this batch answered an *earlier* round that happened to reuse
  the same id." A stale batch from an earlier round can therefore satisfy the filter for a newly-armed
  token it never actually answered — and because the signal-handler correction above requires
  treating a signal as a mere wake-up hint confirmed against exactly this lookup, a rogue or
  coincidental signal matching the new token would find a (wrong) "durable batch" and proceed to
  resume with stale, misapplied answers, rather than correctly finding no match. **Contract
  requirement, superseding the id-membership alternative above:** Coding's own persist path must tag
  each batch with `resume_token` at write time — no schema-change-avoidance shortcut — so its
  reconciliation activity can look up "the batch for this token" exactly as Planning's does, not
  merely "a batch that happens to still mention these ids."

  **`workflow.patched` alone cannot gate this migration — the persist path this requirement changes
  runs outside workflow code entirely, and a pre-existing paused job doesn't know to expect the new
  shape.** `workflow.patched` governs *workflow* replay determinism; it has no effect on
  `coding_team_hitl.submit_pending_answers` (`api/routes/coding_team_hitl.py:21-64`), the HTTP route
  that actually calls `_main.store_append_submitted_answers` to persist each batch — that route runs
  once, synchronously, outside any workflow's history, for *every* job regardless of which patch
  version the target workflow execution itself is on. If this route switches to writing the new
  token-keyed shape unconditionally at deploy time, a `CodingTeamWorkflow` execution that was already
  paused *before* deployment — whose activity, on resume, expects to read the legacy flat
  `submitted_answers` list (`hitl.py:352-377`'s `answers_to_resolved`, `pause_cycle.py:212,380`) —
  receives an answer written in a shape its own pre-patch re-entry reader cannot parse. That job stays
  paused forever (the reader finds nothing matching in the shape it knows how to read) or errors,
  regardless of what the client's HTTP response claimed. **Contract requirement:** the persist path
  and the read paths must support both shapes for the duration of the rollout — either (a) dual-write
  (append to both the legacy flat list *and* a new token-keyed structure on every submission) and
  dual-read (each re-entry reader checks its own expected shape — the pre-patch flat-list reader keeps
  reading the flat list exactly as it does today, unmodified by this migration; the new token-keyed
  reconciliation activity reads only the new token-keyed structure), or (b) a persisted per-job
  schema/version marker the route and every reader inspect to decide which shape that specific job's
  `submitted_answers` is in, set once and never changed for that job's lifetime. Either shape is
  acceptable; unconditionally switching the route's write format at deploy time, relying solely on
  `workflow.patched` to protect in-flight executions, is not — that patch marker protects none of this
  migration's actual failure surface.

  **Correction — the new token-keyed reconciliation activity must never fall back to filtering the
  legacy flat list by question-id membership; that reintroduces the exact stale-answer bug this
  migration's own token-tagging requirement (above) was written to close.** An earlier draft of the
  dual-read shape (a) above described the new reconciliation activity falling back to id-membership
  filtering over the flat list when no token-keyed entry exists — but this contract already
  established, in requiring the token-tagging migration in the first place, that id-membership
  filtering over the accumulated flat history is unsafe for reconciliation: it cannot distinguish "a
  batch answering the current round" from "a batch that answered an earlier round reusing the same
  id," and a stale batch can satisfy the filter for a newly-armed token it never actually answered.
  Adding that same fallback back in for jobs still on the legacy shape does not avoid this hazard, it
  just reintroduces it selectively. **Contract requirement, removing the fallback:** the token-keyed
  reconciliation activity checks only the token-keyed structure; if no entry exists there for the
  given `resume_token` (whether because none was ever written, or because this specific job is still
  on the legacy-only shape mid-migration), it reports "no match" — the same outcome as if eviction had
  discarded a signal and no durable batch exists — never a flat-list membership fallback. The
  pre-patch flat-list reader is unaffected and continues reading the flat list exactly as it does
  today; it is a separate, legacy-only code path this migration does not touch, not a fallback the new
  reconciliation activity shares.

  **The dual-write shape (a) above does not itself require the legacy and token-keyed writes to be
  committed atomically — left unstated, a partial write reintroduces the exact split-visibility
  failure this migration exists to avoid.** If the persist path performs two separate job-store calls
  (one appending to the legacy flat list, one writing the token-keyed entry) and the process or
  job-service call fails after only one succeeds, two distinct failures follow: a pre-patch workflow's
  re-entry reader, expecting the flat list, never sees an answer that was written only to the
  token-keyed structure; and a patched workflow's new reconciliation activity, expecting the
  token-keyed structure, never sees an answer written only to the flat list. Worse, a client or route
  retry of the same partial operation — attempting to complete the missing half — can append a
  duplicate entry to the flat list (which, unlike the token-keyed structure, has no write-once guard
  of its own), corrupting the very history the legacy reader depends on. **Contract requirement:**
  the dual-write must be committed as a single atomic job-store update — one call that writes both
  representations together, succeeding or failing as a unit — not two separate calls a partial failure
  can split; if the underlying job-store primitive cannot express both representations in one atomic
  write, use the schema/version-marker alternative (b) instead, which does not have this atomicity
  requirement since it writes only one representation per job.

**Open risks, not resolved by this spec:**
1. *Carried over from `hitl_pause_resume_contract.md` §4:* `workflow.wait_condition` here is
   unbounded — no timeout and no reconciliation against job-record cancellation. #7445-B inherits
   this exact caveat from the coding-team implementation; it is not a new gap introduced by
   Planning reuse, and remains open future work for both teams alike.
2. *New to this spec, cross-team:* PRA submission (`run_pra`/`run_product_analysis`) has no
   idempotency key, so a worker crash in the narrow window between `run_pra` returning and the
   checkpoint write landing (§4.3.1) can still produce a duplicate external PRA job — mitigated
   here by keeping that narrow step `NO_RETRY`, but not eliminated. Full closure requires
   `software_engineering_team`'s `/product-analysis/run` endpoint to accept a client-supplied
   idempotency key or equivalent reconciliation lookup; that is outside `planning_team`'s boundary
   and this spec's stated scope, and is flagged here as a prerequisite for fully retryable PRA
   submission rather than something #7445-B can close alone.
3. *New to this spec, cross-team:* the answer-delivery reconciliation on a resumed-activity retry
   (§4.3) compares the full canonical question shape as a multiset — `id`, `question_text`,
   `options` (positionally, each option's `id`/`label`/`is_default`/`confidence`), `allow_multiple`,
   `required`, `context`, `recommendation`, `source`, and each option's `rationale` (§4.3's full
   round-identity requirement, not merely the `(id, question_text)` pair an earlier draft of this
   section described) — but PRA's own question parser can still default the `id`/`question_text`
   fields identically across two separate rounds (`question_processing.py:821-822`), and nothing
   prevents every other covered field from *also* coinciding by LLM happenstance, so no comparison
   Planning performs over PRA's reported fields can distinguish "this exact question is still
   pending" from "an unrelated later round coincidentally reproduced the identical shape" with full
   certainty. This is the same class of gap as risk 2: full closure requires a PRA-side round/version
   identifier or delivery receipt, which is outside `planning_team`'s boundary. Comparing the full
   canonical shape reduces the collision surface far more than `(id, question_text)` alone would (it
   catches every case where *any* covered field actually differs) but is not a complete fix even at
   its widest, and #7445-B inherits this residual risk knowingly.
4. *New to this spec, cross-team:* the reconciliation check before step (1)'s submission (above) is
   a read (a PRA status GET) followed by a decision, not a claim — it does not itself prevent two
   overlapping attempts of the *same* resumed activity invocation (the same heartbeat-loss scenario
   as the paused-return and consume-and-clear races above: a lost heartbeat during a `SAFE_RETRY`
   resume attempt lets Temporal start a second attempt while the first keeps running, both carrying
   the same `acknowledged_resume_token`) from both observing "round still pending" and both calling
   `submit_product_analysis_answers` before either reaches the token-guarded clear in step (2). The
   job-store guards elsewhere in this contract (the write-once answer slot in §4.4, the
   resume-token-conditioned clear in this section) protect *this contract's own durable state*; they
   do not protect the external PRA POST itself, which has no compare-and-set of its own. The
   token-guarded clear happens *after* the duplicate side effect, not before it, so it cannot prevent
   it — only prevent the duplicate from being recorded twice locally. This is the same class of gap
   as risks 2 and 3: full closure requires PRA's own submission endpoint to accept an idempotency
   key (e.g. `resume_token`) and de-duplicate identical resubmissions server-side, which is outside
   `planning_team`'s boundary and this spec's stated scope. Until PRA offers that, #7445-B inherits
   the residual risk that a heartbeat-loss race can deliver an answer batch to PRA twice, even though
   this contract's own job record and workflow state stay consistent throughout.
5. *New to this spec, cross-team:* while `PlanningWorkflow` is genuinely paused (a real
   `waiting_for_answers` envelope persisted, the workflow asleep on `wait_condition` for the
   `submit_answers` signal — no activity running at all at that point), a submission through PRA's
   own public answers endpoint (the same direct-to-PRA path this contract already acknowledges is
   possible elsewhere, e.g. §4.3's pause-generation fencing discussion) updates only PRA's internal
   job state and sends **no signal to Planning whatsoever** — Planning's workflow and PRA's job are
   two independent systems connected only by this contract's own signal/resume machinery, which a
   direct PRA submission bypasses entirely. Even if PRA fully completes as a result, Planning's
   workflow has no mechanism to notice: it is asleep on a signal that will never arrive, and nothing
   in this contract polls PRA's status while paused (`wait_pra`'s poll loop only runs *inside* an
   active `document_production_activity` invocation, and none is running while paused). The job
   hangs indefinitely, silently, with no error and no timeout (risk 1, above, already flags the
   underlying unbounded `wait_condition`; this is a distinct way to reach the same hang). **Full
   closure is outside this contract's boundary** and requires one of: PRA itself refusing or
   brokering direct submissions against a PRA job it knows is owned by a paused Planning execution;
   a callback/signal path from PRA back into the owning Planning workflow when answered directly;
   or workflow-side reconciliation (a periodic timer inside `wait_condition`'s wait that polls PRA's
   status independently of the signal path) — any of which is a substantive addition beyond this
   contract's signal-reuse scope. #7445-B inherits this risk knowingly; this contract does not
   claim to close it, only to name it explicitly rather than let it stay an unstated assumption.
6. *New to this spec, cross-team:* the answer-delivery reconciliation's "successful status read
   reporting the question gone" branch (§4.3, "even a successful status read...") is not proof PRA
   actually applied the answer — `store_submit_answers` clears `pending_questions`/
   `waiting_for_answers` synchronously inside the submit route's POST handler, before PRA's own
   background `communicate_with_user` loop necessarily reaches `apply_answers`. A reconciliation
   retry can therefore observe "question gone" purely from POST-acceptance, with application still
   pending or never completed if PRA's worker subsequently crashes. This is the same class of gap as
   risks 2-4: full closure requires PRA to expose a distinct applied/round receipt separate from
   pause-envelope clearing, which is outside `planning_team`'s boundary. #7445-B inherits this
   residual risk knowingly.
7. *New to this spec, planning-internal:* `document_production_pra_submit_activity`'s own
   active-status check (§4.3.1) is a plain read, not a claim — a cancellation or interruption can
   land in the narrow window between that read and the `run_pra()` POST that follows it, since
   nothing holds the row across that gap the way a conditional `UPDATE` would. The check narrows this
   (it catches every case where the job was already terminal *before* the activity ran, the common
   case) but does not close it: a job that becomes terminal in that specific window can still get a
   real external PRA job submitted for it — an orphaned PRA job for a Planning run nothing will ever
   resume. Full closure requires coordinating submission with a durable active-state claim PRA itself
   understands, the same class of gap as risk 2 above; that is outside `planning_team`'s boundary.
   #7445-B inherits this residual risk knowingly; this spec does not claim the plain read eliminates
   the race, only narrows it.
8. *New to this spec, planning-internal:* `document_production_pra_submit_activity`'s
   checkpoint-first read is a plain read, not a claim — an operator-triggered reset or an overlapping
   second workflow execution for the same job can let two concurrent entries each independently read
   the checkpoint as absent and both call the non-idempotent `run_pra`, each submitting a real
   external PRA job, with no crash required anywhere in the sequence (§4.3.1). This is distinct from,
   and broader than, risk 7 above (which is specifically about a job becoming terminal in the
   read-to-POST window) — this risk exists even when the job stays active throughout. §4.3.1 leaves
   closing this to either a durable submission claim/lease #7445-B may add, or explicit acknowledgment
   here; this entry is that acknowledgment. Full closure without a claim/lease requires PRA's own
   submission endpoint to reject or de-duplicate concurrent submissions for the same Planning job,
   which is outside `planning_team`'s boundary and this spec's stated scope. #7445-B inherits this
   residual risk knowingly unless it chooses to add the claim/lease primitive instead.
9. *New to this spec, cross-team:* PRA's own `submitted_answers` history (§4.1) is a single flat,
   unscoped list that `apply_answers` resolves against in its entirety, not only the most recent
   POST — this contract's own round-scoped filtering on Planning's *local* store guarantees Planning
   never *sends* a stale batch, but does nothing about PRA independently resolving a later round's
   omitted-and-optional question from an *earlier* round's still-present entry in that flat history,
   when the two rounds happen to reuse the same question id. This is the same class of cross-team gap
   as risks 2, 3, 4, and 7-8: full closure requires PRA's own submission/resolution path to be
   round-scoped or cleared between rounds, which is outside `planning_team`'s boundary and this spec's
   stated scope — this contract does not mandate that PRA-side change, only names the gap explicitly
   rather than leaving it implied-closed by Planning's own (real, but partial) filtering. #7445-B
   inherits this residual risk knowingly.
10. *New to this spec, cross-team:* the "genuine round advancement proves application" proxy (§4.3,
    the achievable redefinition of the crash-safe clear-after-apply ordering) detects that *something*
    was applied, not that Planning's own persisted batch specifically was. Because this contract
    permits concurrent, independent submission through PRA's own public answers endpoint (§4.1/§4.3),
    a direct caller's batch can be applied in the same window the resume-path activity is between
    persisting its own batch and posting it, producing the same forward-progress signal this proxy
    relies on — the activity then clears and records its own batch as resolved even though PRA's
    actual artifacts reflect the other submission. Full closure requires an acceptance identity from
    PRA tied to submitted content, not merely to round progression, which PRA does not expose; this is
    outside `planning_team`'s boundary. #7445-B inherits this residual risk knowingly.

## 7. Addendum — 2026-09-08: what actually shipped

This section is appended, not merged into the sections above, so the record shows where the
implementation departed from the design and why. **Where this addendum and an earlier section
disagree, this addendum describes the code.**

### 7.1 The never-fabricate rule is bounded to non-terminal rounds

§3 and §5 frame the primitive around never proceeding without a real answer. The shipped
`build_temporal_planning_answer_callback` honours that while another pause round remains, and
deliberately does **not** on a round the caller declares terminal via `allow_repause=False`: it
defaults every unanswered question and returns a complete set.

The reason is a convergence problem this spec did not anticipate. Planning's question ids come
straight from LLM output (`product_requirements_analysis_agent.question_processing.parse_open_question`)
and a resume replays Planning from scratch, so a re-run can mint fresh ids for questions the user
has already answered. An unbounded pause loop therefore never converges — every round pauses on a
newly-minted batch — and PRA's sub-job waits out its own `total_timeout` while nobody is left to
answer it. `RunTeamWorkflowV2` bounds the loop at `MAX_PLANNING_PAUSE_ROUNDS` and spends its last
round with `allow_repause=False`; that flag is the loop's termination proof, not an optimisation.

So the choice on the final round is not *guess vs. wait*. It is *guess vs. hang*. The amended rule:

> The adapter never fabricates an answer while another pause round remains. It defaults only on a
> round the caller has explicitly declared terminal, and every defaulted question is reported to
> the caller for persistence.

The reporting half is what makes the exception acceptable, and is enforced in code rather than by
convention: `on_defaulted` receives exactly the fabricated answers, `plan_project_activity` writes
them to the job record's `defaulted_questions`, and `JobStatusResponse` returns them, so a plan
built partly on machine-chosen answers says so where a human reads it.

Two details of that reporting are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

- **The hook fires once per PRA clarification ROUND, not once per activity execution.**
  `wait_for_product_analysis_completion`'s `_on_poll` invokes the same callback on every poll while
  PRA reports `waiting_for_answers`, and PRA's review loop raises several unrelated rounds with
  fresh ids (§4.3's multi-round case). Under `allow_repause=False` nothing raises, so each round is
  defaulted in turn. A caller that overwrites its store on each call keeps only the last round.
  `plan_project_activity` therefore accumulates, de-duplicating on **`question_id` AND
  `question_text` together** — never the id alone, for the same positional-`q{index}` reason §4.3.1
  already gives for retry reconciliation — and writes the whole accumulated list each time, which
  keeps a Temporal retry idempotent.
- **Each record carries the question text and the chosen option's label, not just ids.** The
  activity clears the pause envelope holding `pending_questions` before the replay, and a defaulted
  terminal batch never raises a pause that would persist the newly generated questions. A record of
  bare, LLM-minted ids would name decisions no human made without saying what was decided. A hook that raises is not
caught — an unrecorded default is the failure this exists to prevent, and failing the round is the
recoverable half of that trade.

### 7.2 The wire contract diverged from §4.1 — read this before wiring any answers route

§4.1 mandates `@workflow.signal(name="submit_answers")` and extends the payload with
`selected_option_ids: List[str]` for `allow_multiple=True` questions. **Neither shipped.** What
exists today:

| Registration | Signal name | State |
|---|---|---|
| `RunTeamWorkflowV2` via `PlanningAnswerSignalMixin` | `submit_planning_answers` | Live — drives the pause loop; `software_engineering_team/api/routes/hitl.py::submit_pending_answers` signals this name |
| `PlanningWorkflow` via `shared/hitl/temporal_signal.py::HitlAnswerSignalMixin` | `submit_answers` | Registered but dormant — `run()` never awaits `wait_for_answers`, so no phase arms a pause |
| §4.1 as written | `submit_answers` + `selected_option_ids` | Unimplemented — `shared/hitl/models.py::AnswerSubmission` still carries only `question_id`/`selected_option_id`/`other_text` |

**Consequence.** An implementer who builds a Planning answers route from §4.1 as written will
signal `submit_answers` at a workflow that registers only `submit_planning_answers`. Temporal
records the signal and delivers it to no handler — precisely the silent-undeliverable failure §4.3
warns about — and the pause never resolves. `PlanningWorkflow` does register `submit_answers`, but
nothing behind it arms a pause, so signalling that workflow type resolves nothing either.

Converging the names — and the three copies of the state machine: `CodingTeamWorkflow`'s inline one,
`PlanningAnswerSignalMixin`, and the shared `HitlAnswerSignalMixin` — is deferred, not resolved here.
It needs a `workflow.patched` migration for histories already recorded against the live name.

**Where that deferral is recorded**, since this addendum deliberately carries no ticket number (see
the project rule against issue references in documentation): `backend/shared/hitl/temporal_signal.py`'s
module docstring is the source of record. It names all three copies, states that migrating
`CodingTeamWorkflow` onto the shared mixin and reconciling `PlanningAnswerSignalMixin` are
"deliberately deferred, not implicitly completed by this module's existence," and forbids composing
both mixins on one workflow class. A reader wanting to pick the work up should start there rather
than from this paragraph. Until it happens, **the shipped name is the one to signal.**

### 7.3 The Planning path is gated off

`plan_project_activity` passes `use_product_analysis=False` on the same `run_planning_workflow`
call that supplies the callback, and `DocumentProductionAgent.run` reaches `answer_callback` only
inside its `if use_product_analysis and run_pra and wait_pra:` branch. The pause loop, the re-pause
path, and the terminal default are implemented and tested, but unreachable in production until that
gate opens. Nothing here describes behaviour users are currently experiencing.
