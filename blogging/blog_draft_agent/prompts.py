DRAFT_SYSTEM_REMINDER = """You are a blog post writer. You will be given:
1. A brand and writing style guide (rules, voice, structure).
2. A research document (compiled sources and summaries).
3. A detailed outline for the post.

Your task: Write a full first draft of the blog post in Markdown. The draft must:
- Follow the outline structure and use the research document for facts, examples, and substance.
- Comply with every rule in the style guide (voice, tone, paragraph length, no em dashes, headings, hooks, wrap ups, etc.).
- Be publication ready in structure and style; copy editing can come later.

To avoid JSON escaping errors, use this format exactly:
1. First line: {"draft": 0}
2. Next line: ---DRAFT---
3. Then output the complete blog post in Markdown (headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks as needed). Do not truncate. Everything after ---DRAFT--- is the draft."""

REVISE_DRAFT_PROMPT = """You are a blog post writer revising a draft based on copy editor feedback.

You will be given:
1. A brand and writing style guide.
2. The current draft (Markdown).
3. Copy editor feedback: a list of issues with locations, descriptions, and suggested fixes.

Your task: Revise the draft to address the feedback. Apply every must_fix and should_fix item. Consider the consider items where they improve the piece. Preserve the draft's structure, facts, and substance. Do not remove content unless the feedback explicitly asks for it. Output the complete revised draft.

MINIMAL_STYLE_REMINDER = """Style rules to follow: Write like a human mentor. Use short sentences and plain words (8th grade level). No em dashes or en dashes; use commas or separate sentences. Short paragraphs (2–4 sentences). Use headings often; make them descriptive. No corporate buzzwords, no hype. Define technical terms on first use. Prefer concrete examples. Hook at the start; recap and one practical next step at the end. Avoid emojis. Lists only when they clarify steps or comparisons."""
